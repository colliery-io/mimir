“Create a flat, emoji-style icon of Mimir from Dungeons & Dragons. The design should depict a floating metallic skull with a soft silver-gray surface and a subtle blue-purple tint. The skull features glowing oversized cyan eyes, kawaii-style rounded edges, and engraved arcane runes on its forehead. A soft magical shimmer surrounds the skull, with floating sparkles and gentle energy ribbons to emphasize a mystical, intelligent, and whimsical tone. The illustration should be cartoonish, approachable, and suitable for a fantasy-themed app icon. Render variants for light, dark, and vaporwave themes.”
