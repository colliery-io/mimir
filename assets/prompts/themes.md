# Light Theme

“Use a soft, pastel fantasy aesthetic with high contrast and gentle luminosity. Base colors on:
	•	Base Metallic/Surface Tones: Pale silvers and soft grays (#cbd5e1, #e2e8f0, #f1f5f9)
	•	Accent Glow Colors: Electric blue (#38bdf8), lavender (#c084fc), and sky blue (#7dd3fc)
	•	Backgrounds: Transparent or warm off-white (#fefce8 or #f8fafc)
	•	Outlines: Charcoal or soft navy (#1e293b or #334155)

Style elements should be clean and cartoonish, with magical sparkles, soft inner glows, and whimsical curves. Avoid harsh shadows. Everything should feel crisp, approachable, and magical.”**


# Dark Theme

“Use a subdued, mystical fantasy aesthetic with glowing contrast. Base colors on:
	•	Base Metallic/Surface Tones: Slate to cool gray (#64748b, #94a3b8, #cbd5e1)
	•	Accent Glow Colors: Cyan (#22d3ee), soft blue (#60a5fa), and pale purple (#a78bfa)
	•	Backgrounds: Transparent or rich black/dark navy (#0f172a, #1e293b)
	•	Outlines/Highlights: Thin bright blue or cyan glow for clarity and mood

Visuals should include soft magical lighting, a cool temperature glow, and subtle gradients. Icons feel calm and wise. Surfaces may include faint shimmer or magical runes. Glow priority is on eyes, symbols, or magical centers.”


Hyper Mode

“Use a vibrant neon fantasy aesthetic with bold saturation and magical energy. Base colors on:
	•	Base Tones: Hot pinks (#ec4899), purples (#9333ea, #8b5cf6), and violets (#a855f7)
	•	Glow Accents: Neon yellow (#fde047), orange (#facc15), and magenta (#f472b6)
	•	Backgrounds: Transparent or rich black (#000000 or #0f0f0f)
	•	Outlines: Deep purple or fuchsia with vibrant neon glow halos

The illustration should pop with saturated energy — scrolls, skulls, gears, and magical glyphs should feel alive with arcane vaporwave light. Use wavy lines, floating sparkles, glowing motion trails, and bold contrast. Kawaii meets synth-fantasy.”**
