# Mimir Character Creation & Maintenance Implementation Plan

## Context

Building a comprehensive D&D campaign management tool requires character creation and maintenance functionality that integrates with existing D&D rules data. Players need an efficient way to build persistent character data - stats, equipment, spell preparation, and level progression - not in-game tracking. The system should focus on between-session character management while supporting printed character sheets for actual gameplay.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Implement complete character creation workflow from stats to final character sheet
- Build character maintenance tools for level advancement and equipment management
- Generate professional print-ready character sheets
- Integrate with existing D&D 5e rules data foundation
- Support between-session character updates and spell preparation

**Non-Goals:**
- Real-time combat tracking (HP, spell slots, resources during sessions)
- Virtual tabletop integration or multiplayer character editing
- Non-5e game systems initially
- AI-generated character content

## Architecture

### Overview
Character system built on existing SQLite foundation with rules engine for automated character building and maintenance. Uses 5etools data conversion pipeline to transform D&D rules into actionable character creation rules.

## Detailed Design

### Phase 1: Database Schema Implementation (Weeks 1-2)
- Create migration framework for schema evolution
- Core character data tables for persistent storage
- Character state JSON structure for complex data
- Rules engine tables for character creation automation

### Phase 2: 5etools Data Conversion (Weeks 3-4) 
- Conversion pipeline for transforming 5etools data into character rules
- Focus on permanent bonuses, maximum values, and character options
- Rule types: grant, select, calculate, require, modify

### Phase 3: Rules Engine Implementation (Weeks 5-6)
- Core engine for applying character creation rules
- Handlers for different rule types with priority system
- Character sheet value calculation (AC, saves, skills, etc.)

### Phase 4: Character Creation Workflow (Weeks 7-8)
- Guided character building with phase validation
- Equipment management and starting gear selection
- Spell selection and preparation workflow

### Phase 5: Character Maintenance (Weeks 9-10)
- Level advancement with class progression
- Between-session equipment and spell management
- Character sheet regeneration after changes

### Phase 6: API and Integration (Weeks 11-12)
- Character management API endpoints
- Campaign integration for party management
- Import/export functionality for character backup

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Strategy**: Component-level testing for rules engine and character calculations
- **Coverage Target**: 90% for core character logic
- **Tools**: Rust test framework for backend components

### Integration Testing
- **Strategy**: End-to-end character creation and maintenance workflows
- **Test Environment**: Isolated test database with sample 5etools data
- **Data Management**: Predefined character creation scenarios

### System Testing
- **Strategy**: Complete character lifecycle from creation to level 20
- **User Acceptance**: DM validation of character sheet accuracy
- **Performance Testing**: Character creation under 10 minutes, level up under 2 minutes

## Alternatives Considered

- **Real-time Combat Tracking**: Rejected to focus on persistent character data and avoid session complexity
- **Web-based Character Builder**: Rejected in favor of desktop integration with existing campaign tools
- **Manual Character Entry**: Rejected in favor of rules-driven automation for accuracy

## Implementation Plan

- **Month 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Foundation - Database schema and 5etools conversion
- **Month 2 (Weeks 5-8)**: Core Engine - Rules engine and character creation workflow  
- **Month 3 (Weeks 9-12)**: Character Management - Maintenance tools and campaign integration
- **Month 4**: Polish and testing with real DM validation
