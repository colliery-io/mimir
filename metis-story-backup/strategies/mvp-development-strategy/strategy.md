# MVP Development Strategy Strategy

## Problem Statement

Building a comprehensive D&D campaign management tool requires tackling multiple complex challenges: data integration, workflow automation, template management, and real-time campaign operations. Without a clear phased approach, we risk building features that don't integrate well or creating a system that's too complex for DMs to adopt.

The MVP strategy focuses on building a GUI-based campaign management platform that streamlines the DM's workflow from campaign creation to session execution. We're pivoting from a terminal-based approach to a modern desktop application using Tauri + Vue 3, which will provide better usability and broader adoption potential while maintaining our local-first architecture.

Each phase delivers standalone value while preparing for the next, ensuring we maintain momentum and can validate our approach with real DMs early and often.

## Success Metrics

- Desktop application launches and functions smoothly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Campaign creation wizard guides DMs through Three-Board System setup in < 5 minutes
- Document and template management allows DMs to organize campaign materials efficiently
- Character creation integration provides seamless player onboarding workflow
- Core D&D data remains queryable in < 100ms via existing backend
- Initial user testing shows 80%+ task completion rate for primary campaign workflows
- Incremental releases every 2-3 weeks with measurable feature completion
- Full MVP delivered within 2-3 months timeline

## Solution Approach

Build Mimir as a modern desktop application using four focused initiatives that deliver incremental value:

**Initiative 1: Tauri Foundation & Campaign Management Core** - Establish the Tauri + Vue 3 application foundation with basic campaign CRUD operations. This creates our GUI platform and core data management layer that all future features build upon.

**Initiative 2: Three-Board System Implementation** - Implement the strategic campaign workflow management system with Backlog, Active, and Archive boards. This provides the core workflow automation that differentiates our approach.

**Initiative 3: Document & Template Management** - Add comprehensive document organization, template library, and content management features. This gives DMs the tools to efficiently organize and reuse campaign materials.

**Initiative 4: Character Creation Integration** - Integrate player character creation workflow with existing D&D rules data backend. This completes the campaign-to-player workflow and leverages our existing data foundation.

Each initiative is independently valuable, reduces technical risk through iterative delivery, and builds toward a cohesive campaign management platform. We'll validate with real DMs after each initiative to ensure we're building the right workflows.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Desktop GUI application using Tauri + Vue 3 + TypeScript
- Three-Board System campaign workflow management
- Document and template organization system
- Campaign creation wizard and management tools
- Character creation integration with existing D&D rules backend
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Local-first architecture maintaining existing SQLite foundation
- Integration with existing D&D 5e rules data
- Template library for common campaign elements

**Out of Scope:**
- Terminal/TUI interface (replaced by GUI)
- Multiplayer/shared campaigns
- Cloud sync or online features
- Non-5e game systems initially
- Combat automation or virtual tabletop features
- Mobile applications
- AI-generated content creation
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced LLM integration (deferred to future phases)

## Risks & Unknowns

- **Technology Learning Curve**: Team may need time to master Tauri + Vue 3 + TypeScript stack
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Desktop application behavior may vary significantly across operating systems  
- **Backend Integration**: Connecting new GUI frontend to existing Rust backend may require significant refactoring
- **User Experience Design**: Creating intuitive workflows for complex campaign management without extensive UX research
- **Performance**: Desktop application responsiveness with large campaign datasets
- **Scope Creep**: Pressure to add advanced features before core workflow is validated
- **Timeline Pressure**: 2-3 month MVP timeline may be aggressive for full-stack application development
- **Data Migration**: Existing development work may need restructuring for GUI architecture

## Implementation Dependencies

**Critical Path:**
1. Initiative 1 (Tauri Foundation) - Must establish GUI foundation before other initiatives
2. Initiative 2 (Three-Board System) - Depends on Initiative 1's application framework
3. Initiative 3 (Document Management) - Can run parallel to Initiative 2 after Initiative 1
4. Initiative 4 (Character Creation) - Depends on existing backend integration patterns from Initiative 1

**Technical Dependencies:**
- Existing SQLite database and D&D rules data (maintained compatibility)
- Tauri framework for desktop application shell
- Vue 3 + TypeScript for frontend development
- Existing Rust backend crates (mimir-dm-db, mimir-dm-core)
- Cross-platform build and distribution pipeline

**Initiative Flow:**
- Initiative 1 establishes technical foundation and patterns for all others
- Initiatives 2-4 can overlap in development once core framework is stable
- Each initiative produces working software with measurable user value
- User testing between initiatives informs UX and workflow decisions
- Backend integration approach from Initiative 1 guides all subsequent work

## Change Log

### GUI Platform Pivot
- **Change**: Pivoted from TUI-based application to GUI desktop application using Tauri + Vue 3
- **Rationale**: Better user adoption potential and workflow usability for campaign management
- **Impact**: Restructured from phase-based to initiative-based approach focusing on campaign workflows

### Initiative-Based Structure  
- **Change**: Replaced three-phase approach with four focused initiatives
- **Rationale**: Initiative structure provides clearer deliverables and better incremental value
- **Impact**: Each initiative delivers standalone value while building toward cohesive platform

### Campaign Management Focus
- **Change**: Shifted primary focus from D&D rules assistant to campaign workflow management
- **Rationale**: Campaign management provides clearer value proposition and workflow automation
- **Impact**: Three-Board System becomes core differentiator with document and character integration

### Initial Strategy
- **Change**: Created initial MVP development strategy with three-phase approach
- **Rationale**: Need structured approach to build complex D&D assistant without overwhelming scope
- **Impact**: Clear roadmap for building foundation → workflows → intelligence in manageable phases
