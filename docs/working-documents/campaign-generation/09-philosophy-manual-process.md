# D&D Campaign Generation: Philosophy and Manual Process

## Core Philosophy

### The Problem We're Solving
Traditional D&D prep often falls into two traps:
1. **Over-preparation**: Creating vast worlds and plots that players never encounter
2. **Under-preparation**: Scrambling before each session, leading to disjointed experiences

Our approach treats campaign management like a creative project with clear phases, deliverables, and feedback loops - but without the corporate baggage.

### Guiding Principles

**1. Just-In-Time Creation**
Create only what you need for the next 2-3 sessions. The world expands as players explore it, not before.

**2. Design to Fit Your Container**
Sessions should reach satisfying endings within your time limit. Don't force 4-hour adventures into 1-hour slots - design 1-hour adventures.

**3. Player-Driven Development**
Build around what excites your players. Their interests and character choices drive world expansion.

**4. Sustainable Pace**
The system should reduce stress, not add it. If prep takes longer than playing, something's wrong.

**5. Living Documentation**
Keep only what helps you run better games. Archives are for memories, not obligations.

## The Manual Process

### What You Need (Physical Tools)
- **Three Binders**: Campaign (strategic), Modules (tactical), Sessions (operational)
- **Index Cards**: For NPCs, locations, and quick references
- **Folder System**: For maps, handouts, and player materials
- **Notebook**: For session notes and player feedback
- **Calendar**: For scheduling and pacing

## Phase 1: Campaign Genesis (Weeks -8 to -4)

### Step 1: The Spark (30 minutes)
**Tools**: Single sheet of paper
**Artifact Created**: Campaign Pitch (Page 1)

Write down:
1. **The Hook**: One sentence that would excite you as a player
2. **The Feeling**: What emotion/experience do you want to create?
3. **The Scope**: How long do you want this to last?

**Why**: You need clarity of vision before building anything. This becomes your north star.
**Future Use**: Referenced before every module to ensure alignment

### Step 2: The Big Three (30 minutes)
**Tools**: Same sheet of paper
**Artifact Created**: Campaign Pitch (Page 1 - continued)

Define:
1. **Big Bad**: Who or what opposes the heroes?
2. **Stakes**: What happens if the heroes fail?
3. **Connection**: Why will the players care?

**Why**: Every story needs conflict, consequences, and personal investment. Without all three, campaigns fizzle.
**Future Use**: Checked monthly to ensure campaign remains on track

### Step 3: The Starting Point (1 hour)
**Tools**: One page for location, one for the world
**Artifacts Created**: 
- Starting Location Sheet (Page 2)
- World Foundation Document (Page 3)

Create:
- **One Settlement**: Name, one interesting feature, one current problem
- **Three World Truths**: Things that make your world unique
- **Session Structure**: How long are your sessions? How will you design to fit?

**Why**: Players need somewhere to start and context to understand. You need constraints to design within.
**Future Use**: Expanded as players explore; referenced for consistency

## Phase 2: Session Zero (Week -4 to -2)

### Step 4: The Invitation (1 hour)
**Tools**: Session Zero packet (3-5 pages)
**Artifacts Created**:
- Session Zero Agenda (Page 1)
- Character Creation Guidelines (Page 2)
- Safety Tools Checklist (Page 3)
- Campaign Expectations (Page 4)
- Scheduling Agreement (Page 5)

Include:
- Campaign pitch (from Step 1-2)
- Character creation guidelines
- Safety tools and boundaries
- Scheduling expectations
- What you need from players

**Why**: Set expectations before anyone invests time in characters. Prevent problems before they start.
**Future Use**: Reference for player disputes; onboarding new players

### Step 5: The Gathering (3 hours)
**Tools**: Character sheets, note paper, relationship map
**Artifacts Created**:
- Completed Character Sheets (1 per player)
- Party Relationship Map (1 page diagram)
- Group Backstory Notes (1 page)
- Final Schedule (1 page)

Run Session Zero:
1. Pitch the campaign (15 min)
2. Establish safety/expectations (15 min)
3. Create characters together (90 min)
4. Build party connections (45 min)
5. Confirm logistics (15 min)

**Output**: 
- Completed character sheets
- Party relationship diagram
- Shared backstory element
- Regular schedule

**Why**: Characters created together are naturally connected. Safety discussions prevent problems. Schedules confirmed upfront stick better.
**Future Use**: Character sheets evolve with play; relationship map guides roleplay; schedule prevents conflicts

### Step 6: Integration (2 hours)
**Tools**: Character notes, world document, module outline
**Artifacts Created**:
- Character Integration Sheet (1 page per PC)
- Updated World Document (additions to Page 3)
- First Module Overview (2-3 pages)

For each character:
- Add one NPC they know to your world
- Create one location tied to their backstory
- Plant one personal plot hook

Create your first module outline:
- Starting situation (picking up from Session Zero)
- 3-4 session arc
- How it introduces the Big Three

**Why**: Players engage when their choices matter. The world should reflect their characters from day one.
**Future Use**: Integration sheets guide personal arcs; module overview structures next 3-4 sessions

## Phase 3: Active Campaign (Ongoing)

### The Three-Board System

**Campaign Board** (Binder 1 - Strategic)
```
[Concept] → [Session Zero] → [Integration] → [Active] → [Concluding]
```
*Check monthly: Are we advancing toward the Big Three?*
**Key Artifacts**: Campaign Pitch, World Foundation, Character Integration Sheets

**Module Board** (Binder 2 - Tactical)
```
[Ideas] → [Planning] → [Ready] → [Active] → [Complete]
```
*Check weekly: Do we have 2-3 sessions of content ready?*
**Key Artifacts**: Module Overviews, NPC Rosters, Location Briefs

**Session Board** (Binder 3 - Operational)
```
[Next Week] → [Prep Needed] → [In Prep] → [Ready] → [Complete]
```
*Check daily (game week): Is this week's session ready?*
**Key Artifacts**: Session Prep Sheets, Recaps, Session Notes

### Weekly Workflow

**Sunday (15 min)**: Write last session's recap
**Artifact Created**: Session Recap (1 page)
- What happened?
- What changed?
- What's next?

**Tuesday (15 min)**: Start session prep
**Artifact Started**: Session Prep Sheet (2 pages)
- Review characters
- Check module status
- Begin 8-step process

**Thursday (30-45 min)**: Finish session prep
**Artifact Completed**: Session Prep Sheet
- Complete 8 steps
- Gather materials
- Review designed ending

**Saturday**: Run session
**Artifacts Created**: 
- Session Notes (during play)
- NPC Cards (as introduced)
- Location Sheets (as discovered)
- Track what happens
- Note player interests
- Reach designed ending

### The 8-Step Session Prep Process

**Creates**: Session Prep Sheet (2 pages)

1. **Review Characters** (3 min): Where are they? What do they want?
   - *Artifact section*: Character Status block
2. **Strong Start** (5 min): First scene that grabs attention
   - *Artifact section*: Opening Scene box
3. **Potential Scenes** (10 min): 3-5 things that might happen
   - *Artifact section*: Scene List with time estimates
4. **Secrets & Clues** (10 min): 10 things they might discover
   - *Artifact section*: Numbered discovery list
5. **Fantastic Locations** (10 min): 2-4 interesting places
   - *Artifact section*: Location blocks with aspects
6. **Important NPCs** (10 min): Who they'll meet and why
   - *Artifact section*: NPC quick stats
7. **Relevant Monsters** (5 min): What they might fight
   - *Artifact section*: Encounter outline
8. **Magic Rewards** (5 min): Treasure that tells a story
   - *Artifact section*: Treasure notes

Total: 58 minutes for a 4-hour session (scales with session length)
**Output**: Complete Session Prep Sheet ready for game day

### Module Creation Process (When at 60% of current module)

**Step 1: Module Concept** (30 minutes)
**Artifact Created**: Module Concept Card
- Review campaign pitch and recent session notes
- Define the module's central question
- Establish stakes and tone shift
- Ensure campaign connection

**Step 2: Module Structure** (1 hour)
**Artifact Created**: Module Overview (2-3 pages)
- Break into session-sized chunks (3-6 sessions)
- Define goal and designed ending per session
- Identify key scenes and pillar balance
- Create session-by-session framework

**Step 3: Module Population** (2 hours)
**Artifacts Created**: 
- NPC Roster Sheet
- Location Brief Cards  
- Clue/Secret Matrix
- Create opposition with multiple defeat conditions
- Design 2-4 key locations with multiple approaches
- Plan information flow with redundant clue paths

**Step 4: Module Testing** (30 minutes)
**Artifact Created**: Contingency Notes
- Verify pacing matches session count
- Ensure player agency throughout
- Confirm campaign advancement
- Plan for common divergences

**Future Use**: Module overview guides next 3-6 sessions; becomes reference during session prep

### Module Transitions

When current module is 60% complete:
1. Review player interests from session notes
2. Check campaign board - how does next module advance the Big Three?
3. Create new module outline (2-3 hours)
4. File in Module binder

**Artifacts Flow**:
- Session Notes → inform Module Ideas
- Module Outcomes → update Campaign Status
- Campaign Pitch → guides Module Creation

### Artifact Flow Between Levels

**Downstream Flow** (Strategic → Operational):
- Campaign Pitch → Module Themes → Session Prep
- World Truths → Location Details → Scene Descriptions
- Character Integration → Personal Arcs → Session Hooks

**Upstream Flow** (Operational → Strategic):
- Session Notes → Module Adjustments → Campaign Evolution
- Player Interests → New Module Ideas → World Expansion
- NPC Popularity → Recurring Characters → Campaign NPCs

**Cross-Level References**:
- Session prep always checks current module overview
- Module planning always reviews campaign pitch
- Campaign health checks review recent session recaps

## Phase 4: Campaign Conclusion

### Recognizing the End

Natural ending signs:
- Big Bad confrontation imminent
- Players achieving character goals
- Story threads converging
- Energy shifting (excitement → satisfaction)

Forced ending signs:
- Players leaving
- Schedule failing
- DM burnout
- Interest waning

### The Graceful Exit

For natural endings (2-4 sessions warning):
1. List open threads
2. Plan resolution order
3. Design climactic confrontation
4. Prepare epilogue framework

For forced endings (1 session):
1. Identify core conflict
2. Create rapid resolution
3. Provide narrative closure
4. Leave room for "what happened after"

### The Minimal Set

If you could only maintain the absolute essentials:
1. **Campaign Pitch** (1 page) - Your north star
2. **Current Module Overview** (2 pages) - What you're running
3. **This Week's Prep** (2 pages) - What's happening next
4. **Character Quick Reference** (1 page) - Who's playing
5. **Last Session Recap** (1 page) - Where you left off

Everything else supports these five core documents.

## Why This Works

### Cognitive Load Management
- **Three levels**: Strategic, tactical, operational thinking
- **Physical artifacts**: External memory reduces mental burden
- **Clear phases**: Always know what to do next
- **Consistent formats**: Similar artifacts work the same way

### Sustainable Pacing
- **1 hour prep : 4 hours play**: Better ratio than most approaches
- **Buffer system**: Always 2-3 sessions ready
- **Pull-based**: Prep only when needed

### Player-Centric Design
- **Their choices matter**: World expands based on interest
- **Designed endings**: Sessions conclude satisfyingly
- **Spotlight tracking**: Everyone gets moments

### Flexibility Within Structure
- **Frameworks not railroads**: Structure supports improvisation
- **Multiple valid paths**: Many ways to reach campaign goals
- **Responsive to table**: System adapts to your group

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

**Pitfall**: Creating too much world upfront
**Solution**: One settlement, expand as needed
**Artifact Tip**: Start with 3 pages max for world info

**Pitfall**: Sessions that drift without ending
**Solution**: Design backward from your cliffhanger
**Artifact Tip**: Write designed ending on prep sheet

**Pitfall**: Losing track of player interests
**Solution**: Note exciting moments during play
**Artifact Tip**: Keep session notes handy during play

**Pitfall**: Module transitions feeling jarring
**Solution**: Start next module prep at 60% complete
**Artifact Tip**: Use module transition notes page

**Pitfall**: Campaign petering out
**Solution**: Regular Big Three check-ins
**Artifact Tip**: Review campaign pitch monthly

**Pitfall**: Artifact overload
**Solution**: Maintain only what you reference
**Artifact Tip**: If you haven't looked at it in 5 sessions, archive it

**Pitfall**: Losing important details
**Solution**: Consistent filing immediately after creation
**Artifact Tip**: File before you eat after the session

## The Heart of It

This isn't about turning D&D into work. It's about removing the stress so you can focus on the fun. When you know:
- What needs prep and when
- How long prep should take
- Where everything is filed
- What success looks like

...then you can relax and tell great stories together.

The system handles the logistics so your creativity can handle the magic.
