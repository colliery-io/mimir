# D&D Module Creation: Systematic Process

## What is a Module?

A module is a complete story arc that:
- Takes 3-6 sessions to complete (adjust for your session length)
- Has a clear beginning, middle, and end
- Advances the campaign's Big Three
- Can be played satisfyingly even if the campaign ends after

Think of modules as "episodes" in your campaign "season" - each tells its own story while building the larger narrative.

## Module Creation Triggers

Start creating a new module when:
- Current module is 60% complete (usually session 2 of 3-4)
- Players express strong interest in a direction
- Campaign needs a tone shift or pace change
- Current module will resolve sooner than expected

## The Module Creation Process

### Phase 1: Concept (30 minutes)

**Tools**: Module Planning Sheet (1 page)
**When**: Current module at 60%

#### Step 1: Review Context
Look at:
- Campaign pitch (are we serving the Big Three?)
- Recent session notes (what excites players?)
- Unresolved threads (what needs attention?)
- Character arcs (who needs spotlight?)

#### Step 2: Define Module Core
Answer:
- **Module Question**: What question will be answered by module's end?
- **Stakes**: What happens if PCs succeed/fail?
- **Tone**: How does this module feel different from the last?
- **Connection**: How does this advance the campaign?

**Artifact**: Module Concept Card
```
Module: [Name]
Question: [What will be resolved?]
Stakes: Success means... / Failure means...
Tone: [Different from last module how?]
Campaign Connection: [Advances Big Three how?]
Sessions: [Estimated 3-6]
```

### Phase 2: Structure (1 hour)

**Tools**: Module Overview Sheet (2-3 pages)
**When**: 2 weeks before needed

#### Step 3: Design the Arc

**For 3-Session Modules** (Short Arc):
1. **Session 1**: Problem Revealed - The hook and initial investigation
2. **Session 2**: Complications Arise - Twists and difficult choices  
3. **Session 3**: Resolution - Confrontation and consequences

**For 4-5 Session Modules** (Standard Arc):
1. **Session 1**: Hook and Discovery
2. **Session 2**: Investigation and Allies
3. **Session 3**: Setback and Revelation
4. **Session 4**: Preparation and Assault
5. **Session 5**: Resolution and Aftermath

**For 6+ Session Modules** (Epic Arc):
- Use three-act structure with 2 sessions per act
- Include downtime/roleplay sessions
- Build to multiple climaxes

#### Step 4: Create the Framework

For each planned session, define:
- **Goal**: What should be accomplished
- **Designed Ending**: The cliffhanger or resolution
- **Key Scene**: The memorable moment
- **Pillar Focus**: Combat, exploration, or social

**Artifact**: Module Session Plan
```
Session X of Module:
Goal: [What gets accomplished]
Designed Ending: [Cliffhanger/resolution]
Key Scene: [The memorable bit]
Pillar: [C/E/S]
```

### Phase 3: Population (2 hours)

**Tools**: Module Details Packet (5-8 pages)
**When**: 1 week before module starts

#### Step 5: Create the Opposition

**Primary Antagonist**:
- Name and role
- Motivation (why they oppose PCs)
- Resources (what they command)
- Victory conditions (what they're trying to achieve)
- Defeat conditions (multiple ways to win)

**Supporting Cast** (2-4 NPCs):
- Name and role
- Connection to conflict
- What they offer PCs
- What they want in return

**Artifact**: NPC Roster Sheet

#### Step 6: Design Key Locations

**Hub Location** (home base):
- Safe place to rest/resupply
- NPCs who provide services
- Hooks for future adventures

**Adventure Sites** (2-4):
- Where key scenes happen
- Environmental challenges
- Secrets to discover
- Multiple entry/exit points

**Artifact**: Location Brief Cards

#### Step 7: Plan Information Flow

**Essential Clues** (must be discovered):
- List 3-5 critical pieces of information
- Provide 3 ways to learn each one
- Never hide behind single roll

**Bonus Secrets** (reward exploration):
- Character-specific revelations
- Campaign foreshadowing
- Advantage-granting intel

**Artifact**: Clue/Secret Matrix
```
Clue: [What they learn]
Found via: 
- Method 1: [How]
- Method 2: [How]  
- Method 3: [How]
```

### Phase 4: Pressure Testing (30 minutes)

**When**: Module ready to run

#### Step 8: The Three Questions

1. **Pacing**: Can this really be done in X sessions?
   - Count required scenes
   - Check against session length
   - Build in flexibility

2. **Agency**: Can players meaningfully affect the outcome?
   - Multiple solution paths?
   - Choices have consequences?
   - Failure is interesting?

3. **Connection**: Does completing this matter?
   - Advances campaign?
   - Develops characters?
   - Players will care?

#### Step 9: Create Contingencies

Plan for:
- Players solving it too quickly (add complications)
- Players getting stuck (add helpful NPCs)
- Players going off-script (know NPC motivations)
- Players avoiding conflict (consequences escalate)

**Artifact**: Contingency Notes

## Common Module Pitfalls

**Too Railroad**: Single solution path
**Fix**: Add two more ways to succeed

**Too Sandbox**: No clear direction  
**Fix**: Strong initial hook with urgency

**Too Complex**: Too many NPCs/locations
**Fix**: Cut 25% of named NPCs

**Too Simple**: Resolved too quickly
**Fix**: Add mid-module twist

**Too Isolated**: Doesn't connect to campaign
**Fix**: Add Big Three connection

**Too Ambitious**: Can't fit in session count
**Fix**: Split into two modules

## The Module Mindset

Think like a TV showrunner:
- Each module is an episode
- Must be satisfying alone
- Must advance the season arc
- Must leave viewers wanting more
- Must fit in the time slot

Your modules are where campaign dreams meet table reality. They're big enough to matter, small enough to complete, and structured enough to deliver consistent fun.

Remember: A great module answers its central question while asking new ones. It resolves immediate stakes while escalating campaign stakes. It satisfies players while leaving them hungry for more.

The best module is the one that gets played, not the one with the most worldbuilding. Focus on what happens at the table, not what's in your notes.
