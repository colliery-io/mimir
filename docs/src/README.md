# Mimir - D&D Campaign Assistant

> *"Remember, I know everything that can be known in the multiverse."* - Mimir, Planescape

Welcome to Mimir, a project to build a local-first D&D campaign assistant. Named after the wise floating skull of Planescape lore, Mimir will help Dungeon Masters manage the cognitive complexity of running campaigns.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Documentation Phase** - We're currently documenting the campaign management framework that will guide Mimir's development.

### What's Available Now

- **[Campaign Generation Framework](./campaign-framework/README.md)** - A complete system for creating and managing D&D campaigns
  - The Three-Board System for organization
  - Campaign genesis process
  - Module creation workflow
  - Session management techniques
  - Ready-to-use templates

This framework represents the methodology that Mimir will eventually automate and enhance.

## Vision

Mimir will be a **terminal-based application** built in Rust that serves as your intelligent campaign companion. The goal is to implement the Campaign Generation Framework as software, adding:

- Local AI integration for creative assistance
- Intelligent NPC and plot tracking
- Automated session preparation
- Privacy-first design with all data stored locally

## Documentation Structure

This documentation follows the [DiÃ¡taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework. Currently available:

- **[Campaign Framework](./campaign-framework/README.md)** - The complete campaign management system

Coming soon:
- Tutorials - Getting started with the software
- How-To Guides - Specific task solutions
- Reference - Technical details
- Explanation - Architecture and design decisions
