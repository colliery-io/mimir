# Phase 5: Campaign Conclusion

Every great story deserves a meaningful ending. This phase guides you through bringing your campaign to a satisfying close, whether after months or years of play.

## Recognizing the Right Time

Campaigns naturally conclude when:
- **Main Quest Complete**: The primary antagonist is defeated or the central quest fulfilled
- **Character Arcs Resolved**: Each PC has achieved or definitively failed their personal goals
- **Story Escalation Peaked**: The stakes can't meaningfully go higher
- **Natural Breaking Point**: Real-world changes (graduation, moves, life events) create a stopping point
- **Energy Depletion**: Better to end on a high note than let the campaign fade

## Planning Your Finale

A well-crafted ending requires preparation. Work backwards from your intended conclusion:

### The 8-Session Countdown

**8 Sessions Before the End**
- Announce to players that the campaign is entering its final arc
- Begin identifying which story threads need resolution
- Start thinking about the climactic confrontation

**6 Sessions Before**
- Begin resolving secondary storylines and subplots
- Close out minor character arcs that won't be central to the finale
- Narrow the focus toward the main conflict

**4 Sessions Before**
- Focus entirely on the primary story arc
- Bring back important NPCs from earlier in the campaign
- Begin callbacks to Session 1 and early adventures

**2 Sessions Before**
- Set up the climactic confrontation
- Ensure all PCs have personal stakes in the finale
- Create urgency that drives toward the conclusion

**Final Session**
- The climaxâ€”consider extending this session to 5-6 hours
- Give each PC at least one spotlight moment
- Make callbacks to the campaign's beginning
- Let player choices determine the outcome

**Epilogue Session (Optional but Recommended)**
- Jump forward in time (months or years)
- Let each player describe their character's future
- Show how the PCs' actions changed the world
- Provide emotional closure for the journey

## What Needs Resolution

Not every thread needs tying up, but be intentional about what you resolve:

### Must Resolve
- **Primary Conflict**: The main quest or antagonist
- **PC Personal Arcs**: Each character's individual story
- **Major NPCs**: Show their fate or final status
- **World Changes**: How the PCs' actions affected the setting

### Can Leave Open
- **Minor Mysteries**: Seeds for potential future campaigns
- **Secondary NPCs**: Unless players are invested in them
- **World Events**: Background happenings not central to the PCs
- **Sequel Hooks**: Deliberately open questions for next campaigns

## Designing the Final Module

Your concluding module should:
- **Callback Earlier Events**: Bring back NPCs, reference old decisions
- **Showcase Growth**: Include challenges the PCs can now handle easily
- **Make It Personal**: Focus on characters, not just the world
- **Provide Agency**: Let player choices shape the ending
- **Allow Sacrifice**: Meaningful victory might require meaningful cost

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't Introduce New Elements
Stick with established story elements. The finale isn't the time for plot twists that invalidate the journey.

### Avoid Deus Ex Machina
Let the PCs be the heroes. They've earned the right to save (or doom) the world themselves.

### Don't Rush
Take the time needed for satisfaction. If the finale needs three sessions instead of one, take them.

### Remember the Characters
The plot serves the characters, not the other way around. Their personal journeys matter more than the world-ending threat.

## Preserving the Campaign

While concluding, capture the campaign for posterity:
- **Campaign Summary**: 2-3 pages of major events and outcomes
- **Character Epilogues**: Document each PC's ending
- **Key Moments**: List 10-15 defining campaign moments
- **Lessons Learned**: What worked, what didn't, what surprised you
- **Reusable Elements**: Identify modules and NPCs worth preserving

## After the End

### Taking a Break
Don't immediately jump into a new campaign. Let this one settle into memory. Give yourself and your players time to process the journey's end.

### The Debrief
Consider having a casual discussion about the campaign:
- What were everyone's favorite moments?
- Which NPCs were most memorable?
- What surprised the players? What surprised you?
- What would people want to see in a future campaign?

### Future Campaigns
Your completed campaign becomes a resource:
- **Sequel Potential**: Same world, new heroes
- **Reusable Modules**: Successful adventures for other campaigns
- **Learned Preferences**: Now you know what your group enjoys
- **Shared History**: Inside jokes and references that bind your group

## The Achievement

Completing a campaign is rare in tabletop gaming. Many campaigns start; few reach meaningful conclusions. You've given your players something precious: a complete story with beginning, middle, and end. That shared narrative creates bonds that last years.

Some groups frame character sheets. Others create photo books. Many simply share one last meal together. However you mark it, take time to appreciate what you've accomplished together.
