# Campaign Genesis Process

## The Journey from Idea to First Session

Creating a new campaign feels overwhelming. Where do you start? What needs to be ready? How much is enough? The Campaign Genesis Process provides a structured path from initial inspiration to your first session, ensuring you build a solid foundation without overpreparation.

This process typically takes 2-3 weeks of casual effort, transforming a vague idea into a playable campaign with room to grow based on player input.

## Tutorial Campaign: The Ironhold Insurrection

Throughout these chapters, we'll build a complete campaign from scratch. You'll see exactly how each phase works with real examples you can adapt for your own use.

**Our Example Campaign**: *The Ironhold Insurrection* - A dwarven city-state faces civil war as ancient clan rivalries explode into violence, while something stirs in the abandoned deeps below.
