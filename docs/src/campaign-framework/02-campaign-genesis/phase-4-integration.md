# Phase 4: Integration and Launch

The final phase transforms Session Zero output into your first module. This module is special—intentionally short (2-3 sessions) to let you observe what excites your players before committing to longer storylines.

## The First Module Is Different

Your first module serves as a testing ground:
- **Short**: 2-3 sessions (6-10 hours of play)
- **Flexible**: Multiple paths to explore player preferences
- **Observable**: Built-in decision points reveal what players enjoy
- **Integrated**: Weaves in Session Zero discoveries

## Integration Principles

Before creating your module, identify how each character connects:

### Character Hooks
For each PC, note:
- **Immediate Connection**: Why this problem matters to them
- **Unique Advantage**: What they bring that others don't
- **Personal Stakes**: What they gain/lose from success/failure
- **Growth Opportunity**: How this challenges their beliefs

### Player Contributions
From Session Zero, list:
- **NPCs Created**: Who can appear in the module
- **Locations Mentioned**: Where scenes might occur
- **Backstory Elements**: What can become relevant
- **Stated Interests**: What types of scenes to include

## Your First Module Goals

Design your first module to:
- **Test Engagement**: Include combat, investigation, and social scenes
- **Branch Early**: Offer meaningful choices by session end
- **Feature Everyone**: Each PC gets at least one spotlight moment
- **Plant Seeds**: Introduce 3-4 potential future plots
- **Stay Flexible**: Don't commit to one campaign direction yet

### Tutorial Example: Understanding Your Party

## Module Design Notes

- Let different backgrounds shine in different scenes
```

## Creating Your First Module

With your character understanding complete, you're ready to create your first module. The [Module Creation chapter](../03-module-creation/README.md) provides the complete workflow for building playable adventures.

### Phase 4 Deliverables

By completing Phase 4's integration planning, you have:
- **Character profiles** showing likely approaches
- **Player contributions** from Session Zero catalogued
- **Design notes** for varied content types
- **Mental preparation** for different play styles

### Time Investment

- **Phase 4 (Integration)**: 2-3 hours
- **Module Creation**: 8-12 hours (see next chapter)
- **Total for First Module**: 10-15 hours

Your first module is intentionally short (2 sessions) to let you observe what works before committing to longer arcs.

## Conclusion

Campaign Genesis transforms the overwhelming task of starting a campaign into a manageable, collaborative process. Phase 4 specifically turns Session Zero excitement into actual playable content that reveals what your unique group wants from the campaign.

The complete module you've created includes:
- Scene-by-scene running guides
- Stat blocks and NPC personalities
- Player handouts and clues
- Contingency plans for common problems
- Branching paths based on player decisions

Your first module is intentionally short—a testing ground that lets you observe and adapt before committing to longer storylines. By the end of Module One, you'll know:
- What kind of stories excite your players
- Which NPCs to develop further
- What balance of combat/social/exploration works
- Which themes resonate with the group

The genesis is complete. The real adventure begins now.

Welcome to your new campaign. May it bring years of unforgettable stories.
