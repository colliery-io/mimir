# Scaling the System

The Campaign Generation Framework is designed for full campaigns, but its processes scale to match your game's scope. This chapter shows how to apply the right amount of planning for different game types.

## Core Principle

The framework consists of three nested processes:
1. **Campaign Genesis** - Establishing the world and context
2. **Module Creation** - Designing story arcs
3. **Session Management** - Running individual games

For shorter games, you simply start at the appropriate level and assume the context from higher levels.

## One-Shot Games

**Process**: Session planning only

For a single 3-4 hour game, jump directly to session management:
- Use the 8-step session prep process
- Assume all context (setting, characters, backstories)
- Provide pre-generated characters or quick builds
- Start in media res: "You've been hired to clear out the demon goat farm"

**Time Investment**: 1-2 hours prep for 4 hours play

**What You Skip**:
- All campaign-level planning
- Module structure and arcs
- Character integration and backstories
- Long-term consequences

## Short Adventures (2-6 sessions)

**Process**: Module planning → Session planning

For a complete story told over several sessions:
- Start with the module creation process
- Design beginning, middle, and end
- Build in meaningful decision points
- Use session management for each game

**Time Investment**: 
- Module creation: 6-8 hours total
- Session prep: 1 hour per session

**What You Skip**:
- Campaign-level world building
- Long-term character arcs
- Faction development
- Campaign health tracking

**Example**: Run "The Brittle Steel Mystery" as a standalone adventure without the broader Ironhold campaign context.

## Mini-Campaigns (2-3 months)

**Process**: Light campaign genesis → Module planning → Session planning

For focused campaigns with definite endpoints:
- Run abbreviated Session Zero (2 hours instead of 4)
- Create minimal framework: pitch + starting scenario
- Plan 2-3 connected modules
- Use full session management

**Time Investment**:
- Initial setup: 4-6 hours
- Module creation: 6-8 hours each
- Weekly session prep: 1 hour

**Simplifications**:
- Limit to one region/city
- Focus on single major conflict
- Streamline to 3-5 key NPCs
- Skip comprehensive world building

## Full Campaigns (6+ months)

**Process**: Complete system as designed

For ongoing campaigns with evolving stories:
- Full campaign genesis process (4 phases)
- Module creation for each story arc
- Weekly session management
- Monthly campaign reviews
- Player character arc tracking

**Time Investment**:
- Campaign genesis: 20-30 hours over 3 weeks
- Module creation: 8-12 hours per module
- Weekly session prep: 1-2 hours
- Monthly reviews: 30 minutes

**Full System Benefits**:
- Deep world consistency
- Meaningful player agency
- Evolving storylines
- Sustainable prep habits

## Convention/Demo Games

**Process**: Pre-generated everything

For showcasing the game or teaching new players:
- Skip all planning processes
- Provide complete pre-gens with established relationships
- Start in the middle of action
- Focus on core gameplay demonstration

**Preparation**: Use existing materials or published adventures

**Key Differences**:
- No player investment needed
- Pure gameplay focus
- Simplified rules demonstrations
- Clear win conditions

## Scaling Guidelines

### When to Scale Up
- Players want deeper investment
- Story needs more context
- Characters develop personal goals
- World consequences matter

### When to Scale Down
- Limited time commitment
- Trying new systems
- Teaching new players
- Testing campaign concepts

### Mixing Scales
You can mix approaches:
- Start with one-shots, expand to mini-campaign
- Run modules between full campaigns
- Use one-shots to test new regions
- Create mini-campaigns as character backstories

## The Key Insight

The framework isn't about using every tool—it's about applying the right level of planning for your game's needs. Templates and artifacts support the process; they don't define it.

Start where makes sense. Scale when needed. The goal is great games, not perfect documentation.
