# Artifact Templates

## The Tools That Make the System Work

This chapter provides practical templates for every artifact in the campaign management system. These aren't just forms to fill out—they're tools refined through years of actual play, designed to capture exactly what you need and nothing more.

Each template follows the principle of Minimum Viable Documentation: capture what you'll use, organize it for quick access, and maintain it with minimal effort.

> **Note**: Full templates are available as separate files in the `templates/` directory for easy copying and customization.

## Key Terminology

To ensure clarity throughout these templates:

- **Session Outline**: The template used during the 8-step prep process to capture your working notes
- **Session Plan**: The polished one-page document you bring to the table, created from your outline
- **Module**: A complete story unit of 3-6 sessions with beginning, middle, and end
- **Arc**: A narrative thread that may span multiple modules or run within a single module
- **Campaign**: The overarching story containing multiple modules
- **Artifact**: Any document, template, or tool used in campaign management

## Customization Guidelines

Templates are starting points—adapt them to your needs:

- **Remove** sections you won't use
- **Expand** areas that need more detail  
- **Combine** templates for simpler games
- **Create** new templates for your specific genre

## The Minimal Viable Set

If you're overwhelmed, start with just these four:

1. **Quick Start Kit** - Everything you need in simplified form
2. **Module Overview** - Plan your story arc
3. **Session Outline** - Weekly prep tool
4. **Quick NPC Reference** - Game night essentials

You can always expand later as your needs grow.

## Download and Customize

All templates are available as markdown files for easy customization. Copy what works, modify what doesn't, and create your own sustainable documentation practice.

Remember: The best template is the one you actually use. These tools serve your game, not the other way around.
