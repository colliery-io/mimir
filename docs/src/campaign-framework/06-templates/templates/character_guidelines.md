# Creating Your Character for {{ campaign_name }}

## Core Concept
{{ core_concept }}

## Ancestry Options
{{ common_ancestries }}

## Class Considerations
{{ valued_classes }}

## Starting Bonds
Every character needs:
{{ starting_bonds }}

## Party Connections
During Session Zero, we'll establish deeper connections between PCs:

- **Professional**: Shared occupation, guild membership, or rivalry
- **Circumstantial**: Met during a significant event
- **Reputational**: Know each other by reputation
- **Transactional**: Owe each other favors or share a debt

We'll create 2-3 connections per character during Session Zero.

## Character Creation Process
1. Choose your ancestry and class
2. Develop your background and motivations
3. Consider how you fit into the world
4. Think about connections to other characters
5. Leave room for growth and discovery

## What Makes a Good Character
- Has clear motivations beyond "adventure"
- Connects to the world through relationships
- Works well with others (even if reluctantly)
- Has both strengths and flaws
- Leaves room for growth

## Questions to Consider
- What brought you to this moment?
- What do you hope to achieve?
- What are you running from or toward?
- Who matters to you in this world?
- What would make you take risks?

## Next Steps
Come to Session Zero with a character concept. We'll refine it together and create connections that bind the party into a cohesive group.
