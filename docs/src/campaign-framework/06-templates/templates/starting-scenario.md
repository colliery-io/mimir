# Starting Scenario: {{ scenario_name }}

## Where You Are
[1-2 paragraphs about the specific location where characters have been staying. How long? What's the immediate neighborhood like? Focus on their direct experience.]

## Recent Events
[2-3 short incidents that happened recently in the area. Characters might have been involved in one or more, in different ways. This gives them touchpoints without forcing everyone into the same story.]

- **[Event 1]**: [What happened, multiple ways to be involved]
- **[Event 2]**: [What happened, multiple ways to be involved]  
- **[Event 3]**: [What happened, multiple ways to be involved]

[1 sentence about how competent people notice each other in this environment.]

## The Opportunity
[The immediate situation that kicks off the adventure. Who's hiring? What do they want? Why outsiders? Keep it simple and concreteâ€”save complexity for later.]

## What to Consider
- [Question about why they came here]
- [Question about what unique skills they offer]
- [Question about connections to other PCs]
- [Question about personal motivation]

## Practical Details
**Starting Situation**: [Their current status in the community]
**Resources**: [What they begin with beyond standard equipment]
**Meeting Point**: [Where the adventure begins]

[Brief closing that sets expectations without spoiling the adventure]
