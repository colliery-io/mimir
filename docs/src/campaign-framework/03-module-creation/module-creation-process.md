# The Module Creation Process

Building a module follows a systematic four-phase process that transforms initial ideas into playable content. This workflow ensures you create complete, engaging adventures while respecting your prep time.

## The Four-Phase Creation Process

### Phase 1: Concept Development (2-3 hours)

Transform triggers into actionable module concepts.

**Step 1: Define the Core**
- What's the central conflict/mystery/challenge?
- How does it connect to campaign themes?
- What makes this module memorable?

**Step 2: Establish Stakes**
- What happens if players succeed?
- What happens if they fail?
- What happens if they don't engage?

**Step 3: Create the Hook**
- How do players learn about this?
- Why must they act now?
- What makes it personally relevant?

**Concept Template**:
```
Module: [Title]
Core Concept: [One sentence summary]
Stakes: Success = [outcome], Failure = [outcome]
Hook: [How players get involved]
Theme: [What this module is really about]
Estimated Sessions: [2-6]
```

### Phase 2: Structure Design (2-3 hours)

Build the module's skeleton before adding flesh.

**The Five-Room Dungeon Model** 

This is a structural framework (not literal rooms) that works for any module type:
1. **Entrance/Guardian**: Initial challenge establishing tone
2. **Puzzle/Roleplay**: Non-combat challenge requiring thought
3. **Setback/Twist**: Complication changing the situation
4. **Climax/Boss**: Major confrontation or decision
5. **Revelation/Reward**: Payoff and future hooks

Think of it as a story structure - whether you're running a mystery, heist, or dungeon crawl, you still want these dramatic beats. The Module Type Templates (Mystery, Heist, etc.) define WHAT kind of story you're telling, while the Five-Room structure helps you pace HOW you tell it.

**Session Breakdown Planning**:
- Session 1: Hook, introduction, initial challenge
- Session 2-3: Investigation, development, complications
- Session N-1: Rising action, point of no return
- Session N: Climax, resolution, aftermath

**Critical Path Mapping**:
Identify the minimum required elements:
- Information players MUST discover
- NPCs they MUST encounter
- Locations they MUST visit
- Choices they MUST make

Then add optional content around this spine.

### Phase 3: Population (3-4 hours)

Fill your structure with engaging content.

**NPC Creation Priorities**:
1. **Quest Giver**: Who presents the module?
2. **Primary Antagonist**: Who opposes the players?
3. **Key Informant**: Who provides crucial information?
4. **Wild Card**: Who complicates matters?
5. **Supporting Cast**: 2-3 minor but memorable NPCs

**Location Development**:
- **Hub Location**: Where players return/resupply
- **Challenge Sites**: Where conflicts occur
- **Information Sites**: Where clues are found
- **Transition Spaces**: How players move between

**Encounter Design Mix**:
- 40% Combat (varied difficulty and type)
- 30% Social (negotiations, investigations)
- 20% Exploration (discovery, problem-solving)
- 10% Wildcard (unique to your module)

**Information Architecture**:
- **Essential Clues**: Multiple sources for each
- **Bonus Information**: Rewards thorough investigation
- **Red Herrings**: 1-2 maximum, must be interesting
- **Foreshadowing**: Next module seeds

### Phase 4: Pressure Testing (1-2 hours)

Ensure your module survives contact with players.

**The Three-Path Test**:
Can players complete your module if they:
1. **Combat Path**: Fight everything possible?
2. **Social Path**: Talk their way through?
3. **Stealth Path**: Avoid direct confrontation?

**The Failure Cascade**:
What happens when:
- Players miss crucial information?
- Key NPCs die unexpectedly?
- Players skip major locations?
- Time pressure expires?

**The Interest Check**:
- Does each session end with a cliffhanger?
- Are there meaningful choices throughout?
- Do player actions visibly matter?
- Is the climax worth the buildup?

## Creating Module Documents

Your final module package should include:

### Session Notes (Your Reference Document)
- Complete NPC stats and personalities
- Location descriptions and maps
- Encounter details and alternatives
- Information/clue placement
- Contingency plans


### Quick Reference Sheets

- Initiative tracker templates
- NPC name/voice notes
- Critical rule references
- Improvisation tools

## Time Management

**Total Creation Time**: 8-12 hours for a 3-4 session module

**Time Breakdown**:
- Concept: 2-3 hours
- Structure: 2-3 hours
- Population: 3-4 hours
- Pressure Testing: 1-2 hours
- Documentation: 1-2 hours

**Efficiency Tips**:
- Reuse NPC templates
- Build location libraries
- Create encounter formulas
- Maintain clue patterns

## Common Creation Pitfalls

### Over-Planning
**Symptom**: 40+ pages for a 3-session module
**Solution**: Focus on critical path + improvisation tools

### Under-Planning
**Symptom**: "I'll just improvise everything"
**Solution**: Minimum viable structure prevents aimless sessions

### Railroad Design
**Symptom**: One solution to every problem
**Solution**: Three-path test ensures flexibility

### Kitchen Sink Syndrome
**Symptom**: Every cool idea crammed into one module
**Solution**: Save ideas for future modules

## Module Creation Checklist

Before running your module, verify:

**Concept**
- [ ] Clear central conflict
- [ ] Meaningful stakes
- [ ] Compelling hook
- [ ] Thematic unity

**Structure**
- [ ] Session breakdown planned
- [ ] Critical path identified
- [ ] Multiple solution paths
- [ ] Satisfying climax

**Content**
- [ ] NPCs statted and motivated
- [ ] Locations described
- [ ] Encounters balanced
- [ ] Information redundancy

**Testing**
- [ ] Three paths work
- [ ] Failure states planned
- [ ] Interest maintained
- [ ] Documents complete

## Module Creation Summary

The four-phase process transforms vague ideas into playable content:

1. **Concept** (2-3 hours): Core conflict, stakes, hook
2. **Structure** (2-3 hours): Session breakdown, critical path
3. **Population** (3-4 hours): NPCs, locations, clues
4. **Testing** (1-2 hours): Multiple paths, failure states

Total: 8-12 hours for a complete module

Remember: Theory becomes practice through repetition. Each module you create becomes easier as you develop your own templates and understand your players better.

## Next Steps

With your module created, the next chapter covers specific templates for different module types, from mysteries to heists to political intrigue. The final chapters address running modules effectively and creating your first 2-session module after Session Zero.
