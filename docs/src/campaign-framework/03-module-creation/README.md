# Module Creation Overview

## Building Sustainable Story Arcs

Modules are the backbone of sustainable campaign management—self-contained story arcs spanning 2-6 sessions that advance your campaign while maintaining creative flexibility. Think of them as episodes in a television series: complete stories that contribute to the larger narrative without requiring the entire series to be written in advance.

This chapter introduces module concepts and structure. The following sub-chapters provide detailed workflows, templates, and examples for creating your own modules.

## What Makes a Module?

A module is more than just connected sessions—it's a complete dramatic structure with:

- **Clear Beginning**: Inciting incident that launches the action
- **Rising Action**: Escalating challenges and revelations
- **Climax**: Decisive confrontation or choice
- **Resolution**: Consequences and setup for future modules
- **Thematic Unity**: Consistent tone and focus throughout

### Why Your First Module Is Different

Your first module after Session Zero serves a special purpose: it's a testing ground to discover what your specific group enjoys. Keep it short (2 sessions), include varied content types, and build in explicit decision points that reveal player preferences. This investment in observation pays off in all future modules.

### Module Scope Guidelines

**2-Session First Module** (6-10 hours of play):
- Single location with 2-3 areas
- One clear problem with multiple approaches
- 2-3 major NPCs plus supporting cast
- Branching paths to test player preferences
- Built-in observation points
- Best for: Campaign launch, learning player preferences

**3-Session Modules** (12-16 hours of play):
- Single location or tightly connected areas
- One primary antagonist or challenge
- 2-3 major NPCs
- Linear progression with some branching
- Best for: Introductory arcs, focused missions

**4-Session Modules** (16-20 hours of play):
- Multiple related locations
- Primary and secondary objectives
- 4-6 major NPCs
- Branching paths with convergent climax
- Best for: Standard campaign arcs

**5-6 Session Modules** (20-30 hours of play):
- Regional exploration or complex situations
- Multiple antagonists or layered challenges
- 8-10 major NPCs
- Open structure with multiple solutions
- Best for: Major campaign turning points

## When to Create a New Module

Module creation triggers include:

### Natural Triggers
- **Current Module Completion**: Players achieved module objectives
- **Narrative Momentum**: Story demands new direction
- **Player Goals**: Character objectives require new content
- **Campaign Phase**: Moving between campaign acts

### Warning Signs
- **Aimless Sessions**: Players unsure of objectives
- **DM Fatigue**: Current content feels stale
- **Scattered Focus**: Too many unrelated threads
- **Player Disengagement**: Interest visibly waning

### Emergency Triggers
- **Total Party Kill**: Need reset with consequences
- **Major Derailment**: Players completely off-track
- **Real-World Changes**: Player availability shifts
- **Creative Block**: Current direction isn't working

## How Modules Are Created

The [Module Creation Process](./module-creation-process.md) chapter details the systematic four-phase workflow for building modules:

1. **Concept Development** - Transform ideas into actionable concepts
2. **Structure Design** - Build the module's skeleton
3. **Population** - Fill with NPCs, locations, and encounters
4. **Pressure Testing** - Ensure multiple paths to success

This process typically takes 8-12 hours for a standard 3-4 session module, or 6-8 hours for your first 2-session module.

## Module Types

The [Module Types and Templates](./module-types-templates.md) chapter provides detailed templates for:

**Core Module Types**:
- **Mystery Modules** - Investigation and revelation
- **Heist Modules** - Planning and execution  
- **Dungeon Crawl Modules** - Location-based exploration
- **Political Intrigue Modules** - Faction navigation
- **Exploration Modules** - Journey into the unknown
- **Siege Modules** - Defense against overwhelming odds
- **Survival/Horror Modules** - Resource depletion and fear
- **War/Military Modules** - Large-scale strategic conflicts
- **Rescue/Escort Modules** - Protection and extraction
- **Base Building/Domain Modules** - Long-term development

Each template includes pacing guides, critical design elements, and common pitfalls to avoid. The chapter also covers module interfaces, failure states, and adaptation guidelines.

## Running Modules

The [Running Your Module](./module-running.md) chapter covers:
- Session management during modules
- Handling derailments and adjustments
- Transitioning between modules
- Common challenges and solutions

## Your First Module

The [Your First Module](./module-first.md) chapter provides special guidance for creating your initial 2-session module after Session Zero, including:
- Observation techniques
- Integration requirements
- Simplified structure
- Analysis methods

## Module Creation Summary

Creating effective modules requires:
- **Clear Structure**: Beginning, middle, end with rising tension
- **Player Agency**: Multiple paths to success
- **Campaign Integration**: Connect to themes and backstories
- **Flexible Design**: Accommodate different play styles
- **Reasonable Scope**: Match content to session count

Time Investment:
- First module: 6-8 hours for 2 sessions
- Standard module: 8-12 hours for 3-4 sessions  
- Complex module: 12-16 hours for 5-6 sessions

Each hour of prep typically yields 2-3 hours of gameplay, improving with experience.
