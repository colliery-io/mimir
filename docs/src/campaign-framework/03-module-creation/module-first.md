# Your First Module

This chapter walks through the complete planning process for the first module of our tutorial campaign, *The Ironhold Insurrection*. We'll create "The Brittle Steel Mystery" step-by-step, showing exactly how to build a 2-session module that integrates Session Zero results and sets up your campaign.

## Why This Module Works as a First Adventure

Before we dive into planning, understand why we're building this specific module:

**It's Short**: 2 sessions lets us test and adjust quickly
**It's Integrated**: Uses NPCs and locations from Session Zero  
**It's Flexible**: Three different endings based on player choices
**It's Observable**: Built-in moments to learn player preferences
**It's Connected**: Introduces larger campaign mysteries

## Module Planning Overview

Let's build this module using the four-phase process from the Module Creation chapter, applying each step to create our 2-session mystery.

### Quick Module Summary
- **Title**: The Brittle Steel Mystery
- **Sessions**: 2 (6-8 hours total)
- **Type**: Mystery with combat, investigation, and social elements
- **Core Problem**: The Royal Forge is producing brittle steel, threatening clan war
- **Three Possible Villains**: Depending on which path players choose
- **Integration**: Uses 3 NPCs and 2 locations from Session Zero

## First Module Creation Process

Let's create an actual first module using our tutorial campaign, *The Ironhold Insurrection*, to demonstrate each step.

### Step 1: Review Session Zero (1 hour)

Extract actionable elements from our Session Zero:

```markdown
# Session Zero Review - Ironhold Insurrection

## Character Profiles
- Sarah (Human Wizard): Studied with Deepguard, analytical
- Marcus (Human Fighter): Bodyguard, tactical, protective
- Tom (Halfling Rogue): Criminal contacts, knows underworld
- Lisa (Half-elf Cleric): Commerce deity, diplomatic

## Player-Created Elements
NPCs:
- Master Runekeeper Thorek Greystone (Sarah's sponsor)
- "Lucky" Finn Copperwhistle (Tom's contact)
- Young Dain Brightstone (nephew saved)

Locations:
- The Lucky Pickaxe (gambling den, 50gp buy-in)
- The Brass Monkey (where party stays/meets)

## Observed Interests
- Sarah: Magical mysteries, ancient knowledge
- Marcus: Protecting innocents, earning respect
- Tom: Underworld politics, making connections
- Lisa: Preventing violence, building bridges

## Campaign Tone
- Political thriller in fantasy setting
- Moral ambiguity welcomed
- Consequences matter
```

### Step 2: Design the Problem (1 hour)

Our first module: **"The Brittle Steel Mystery"**

```markdown
## The Problem

The Royal Forge - pride of Ironhold - has produced a batch of 
brittle steel. Weapons shatter, armor cracks, tools break.

Why This Works:
- Immediate threat (failing forges = city dies)
- Affects all clans (everyone needs steel)
- Multiple suspects (clan rivalry)
- Various solutions (investigate, negotiate, infiltrate)
- Connects to larger mystery (why are forges failing?)

The Hook:
Merchant Consortium hires party to investigate quietly.
Their last team vanished in Undertown.
1,000gp each for answers before the clan moot (3 days).
```

### Step 3: Build Decision Points (2 hours)

Structure explicit choices throughout:

```markdown
## Key Decision Points

SESSION 1 DECISIONS:
1. Opening: How to approach Torin Ironfoot?
   - Diplomatic (Lisa leads)
   - Deceptive (Tom leads)
   - Scholarly (Sarah leads)
   - Direct (Marcus leads)

2. Investigation: What to examine first?
   - The forge itself (magical/technical)
   - The workers (social/intimidation)
   - The materials (exploration/tracking)

3. Cliffhanger: Which lead to pursue?
   - Path A: Goldbeard apprentice acting suspicious
   - Path B: Deepguard mystics performing rituals
   - Path C: Strange noises from sealed tunnels

SESSION 2 DECISIONS:
4. Approach: How to handle chosen lead?
   - Confront directly
   - Investigate secretly
   - Seek allies first

5. Resolution: How to stop the threat?
   - Combat solution
   - Social solution
   - Clever solution
```

### Step 4: Create Modular Scenes (3-4 hours)

Build flexible encounters that can be inserted based on player choices:

```markdown
## Modular Scene Toolkit

### Combat Encounters
1. **Corrupted Elemental** (Medium)
   - Forge guardian driven mad
   - Screams clues in Primordial
   - Environmental hazards (heat, collapsing equipment)

2. **Cultist Ambush** (Hard)
   - 4-6 Duergar cultists
   - Darkness + poisoned weapons
   - One tries to flee with evidence

3. **Clan Thugs** (Easy)
   - 3-4 warriors from rival clan
   - Want to intimidate, not kill
   - Can be talked down

### Social Encounters
1. **Torin Ironfoot** (Master Smith)
   - Proud, devastated, defensive
   - Key info: Sabotage methods
   - Wants: Forge honor restored

2. **Dain Goldbeard** (Apprentice)
   - Nervous, eager to please
   - Key info: Strange shipments
   - Secret: In love across clans

3. **Keeper Morak** (Deepguard Mystic)
   - Whispers, quotes scripture
   - Key info: Ancient warnings
   - Agenda: Purify traditions

### Exploration Scenes
1. **Forge Investigation**
   - Find alchemical residue
   - Discover sabotage evidence
   - Elemental acts strangely

2. **Undertown Tracking**
   - Follow suspicious shipments
   - Navigate criminal territories
   - Find cult meeting place

3. **Archive Research**
   - Ancient texts about forge magic
   - Prophecies about failing metal
   - Maps of sealed tunnels
```

### Step 5: Prepare Observation Tools (1 hour)

Create simple tracking sheets:

```markdown
## Session Observation Sheet

ENGAGEMENT TRACKING:
□ Combat Scene: Low / Medium / High
□ Social Scene: Low / Medium / High  
□ Investigation: Low / Medium / High
□ Planning Time: Too Short / Just Right / Too Long

NPC REACTIONS:
□ Torin: Connected / Neutral / Rejected
□ Dain: Befriended / Suspicious / Hostile
□ Morak: Intrigued / Dismissive / Threatened

APPROACH PREFERENCES:
□ Preferred: Combat / Stealth / Diplomacy
□ Information gathering: Systematic / Chaotic
□ Problem solving: Direct / Clever / Cautious

PACING NOTES:
□ Session felt: Rushed / Balanced / Dragging
□ Players wanted: More RP / More Action / More Mystery
```

## The Complete First Module

Here's how all the pieces come together for "The Brittle Steel Mystery":

Note how we're using the Five-Room Dungeon structure for our Mystery module:
1. **Entrance**: Meeting with Thora (establishes tone)
2. **Puzzle**: Investigating the forge (non-combat challenge)
3. **Setback**: Elemental attack (complication)
4. **Climax**: Confronting the villain (varies by path)
5. **Revelation**: Truth exposed, larger threat hinted

The Mystery template tells us WHAT to include (clues, suspects, investigation), while the Five-Room structure tells us HOW to pace it dramatically.

### Complete Session Notes: Session 1

```markdown
# Session 1: The Investigation

## Opening Scene (30 min)
**Location**: Brass Monkey Tavern, late afternoon

*Read aloud*: 
"The Foreign Quarter reeks of coal smoke and anxiety. Inside the 
Brass Monkey, dice clatter at Lucky's table while merchants argue 
in six languages. Thora Brightstone waits in a corner booth, her 
fingers drumming against a sealed letter."

**Thora's Briefing**:
- Royal Forge produced brittle steel yesterday
- Ironfoot clan blames Goldbeard sabotage  
- Last investigation team found dead in Undertown
- 1,000gp each for answers before clan moot (3 days)
- Bonus 1,000gp each if violence prevented

**Key Information**:
- "Master Smith Torin Ironfoot runs the Royal Forge. He's... proud, traditional, but honest. He'll be devastated by this failure."
- "Tell him I sent you. He respects the Consortium, even if he doesn't like outsiders."
- "The Royal Forge is in the Ironfoot district. You can't miss it - largest chimney in the city."

**Key Responses**:
- Previous team: "Empty eyes, no wounds. Like their souls were... extracted."
- Why outsiders: "Clan investigators would start a war, not prevent one."
- Time pressure: "The moot is in three days. After that..." *shakes head*
- About Torin: "He's been Master Smith for forty years. The forge is his life."

## The Royal Forge (45 min)

**Approaching Torin Ironfoot**:
- DC 15 Persuasion: Full cooperation
- DC 10: Grudging access
- Failure: Must sneak in later

**If They Must Sneak In**:
- Wait until shift change at dusk (workers tell them)
- DC 13 Stealth to avoid guards (advantage if Tom scouts first)
- DC 10 Thieves' Tools on side entrance OR DC 15 Athletics to climb
- Inside: Same investigation opportunities but rushed
- If caught: Guards summon Torin, very suspicious (-5 to future social rolls)
- Auto-triggers elemental if approaching sacred flame (Option C)

**Investigation Opportunities** (either approach):
- DC 12 Investigation: Find alchemical residue
- DC 18 Arcana: Identify as Underdark compound
- DC 14 History: Recall forge's 800-year history
- DC 10 Perception: Notice elemental agitation

**Torin Ironfoot Roleplay**:
- Voice: Deep, slow, mournful
- Mannerism: Touches equipment like old friends
- Key phrases: "The forge never lies" / "Iron remembers"
- If asked who might know about forge magic/corruption: "Well... my daughter Thera works at the Deepguard archive. She might have seen texts about forge guardians. Though she mentioned Keeper Morak has been restricting access lately. Very strict about 'maintaining purity.' Strange behavior, even for Deepguard."

**Triggering the Elemental** (any of these):

**Option A - Torin's Assistance** (if investigation going well):
*"Let me wake the guardian to help your investigation. It's witnessed every forging for eight centuries..."*

**Option B - Time Pressure** (if investigation stalling):
*"We need to restart the forge for the afternoon shift. Let me just check with the guardian first..."*

**Option C - Failed Stealth** (if they sneak in):
The guardian automatically activates when non-dwarves approach the sacred flame without proper introduction.

**Option D - Worker Accident** (if ignoring everything):
A panicked apprentice runs in: *"Master Torin! The guardian's acting strange! It won't let us near the—"*

**The Activation**:
Regardless of trigger, the temperature spikes. The elemental emerges—but wrong. Where it should be controlled flame, it's wild, glass-edged, screaming.

*"No! What's happened to you, old friend?"* (or if Torin's not present: Workers flee screaming)

## Corrupted Elemental Attack (30 min)

**Modified Fire Elemental** (CR 5, adjusted for level 3 party)
AC: 13, HP: 75, Speed: 50 ft
Fire Form: Creatures ending turn within 5 ft take 1d10 fire damage
Multiattack: Two touch attacks, +6 to hit, 2d6 fire damage
NEW - Brittle Aura: Metal weapons hitting it must save DC 13 or crack

**Combat Dynamics**:
- Screams "POISON! BETRAYAL! THE DEEP HUNGERS!" in Primordial
- Explodes into glass shards when defeated (clue!)
- Workers to protect (failure = reputation loss)

**Environmental Hazards**:
- Extreme heat: DC 12 CON save or 1 exhaustion
- Collapsing equipment: DC 14 DEX saves
- Smoke: Heavily obscured areas

## Post-Combat Investigation (15 min)

**Immediate Aftermath**:
- Torin devastated: "The forge guardian... it protected us for centuries"
- Glass shards contain alchemical residue (same as sabotage)
- Workers whisper about "the old warnings"

**Quick Investigation Reveals**:
- DC 10 Investigation: Elemental was summoned recently, not original
- DC 12 Arcana: Corruption matches Underdark magical signatures
- DC 15 History: Similar to records of the "Deep Hunger" incidents

**Three Witnesses Approach** (separately):
- Nervous apprentice: "I saw Dain Goldbeard here at midnight..."
- Devout smith: "Keeper Morak warned this would happen if we strayed from the old ways. He's been holding purification rituals every night this week..."
- Veteran guard: "Strange sounds from the sealed tunnels for weeks..."

**Additional Path B Clues** (if witness missed):
- Glass shards have religious symbols etched in them (DC 12 Religion)
- A Deepguard acolyte was seen blessing forge tools yesterday (worker mentions)
- Sarah's sponsor Thorek arrives: "This corruption... it matches warnings in restricted Deepguard texts. What has Morak been doing?"

## Session 1 Cliffhanger (15 min)

Players must choose which lead to investigate. Present all three, then let them debate:

**Path A - Goldbeard Workshop** (Clan District):
- Lead: "Dain Goldbeard was seen at the forge at midnight, carrying strange bottles"
- Location: Goldbeard clan workshop, rival district
- Contact: The nervous apprentice offers to guide them
- Cliffhanger: Arrive to find Dain frantically destroying evidence. He sees the party, panics: "It's not what it looks like! They made me—" *CRASH* as the door splinters open...
- *End session*

**Path B - Deepguard Archive** (Temple District):
- Lead: "Keeper Morak's been performing forge purification rituals nightly"
- Location: Deepguard Archive beneath the Temple of Stone
- Contact: Thorek Greystone (Sarah's sponsor) can get them inside
- Cliffhanger: Descending into the archive, they hear chanting. Through a doorway, Morak stands before a ritual circle, raising a hammer over a forge-flame replica: "Tonight, we cleanse the corruption forever!" The hammer begins to glow...
- *End session*

**Path C - Sealed Tunnels** (Undertown):
- Lead: "Strange sounds from the sealed tunnels, like whispers in the dark"
- Location: Ancient tunnel entrance in Undertown
- Contact: Lucky Finn (Tom's contact) knows a way past the guards
- Cliffhanger: Breaking through old boards, they find the seal cracked, darkness beyond. Tom's character recognizes fresh Duergar runes. Then from the depths: "Finally... visitors. Come closer, let me see you properly..." 
- *End session*
```

### Session 2 Preparation Notes

## Session 2: Just-In-Time Creation

Based on which path the players chose, you'll create Session 2 between games. 
This is intentional - don't over-prepare what might not be used!

```markdown
## Path-Specific Prep Notes

**If They Chose Path A (Goldbeard Workshop)**:
Key Elements to Develop:
- Dain's actual innocence and frame job
- Who's framing him and why
- Love story with Ironfoot daughter

- Evidence pointing to larger conspiracy

**If They Chose Path B (Deepguard Archive)**:
Key Elements to Develop:
- Morak's religious justification
- The purification ritual mechanics
- How to stop/redirect it
- Deepguard tests and puzzles
- Consequences of success/failure

**If They Chose Path C (Sealed Tunnels)**:
Key Elements to Develop:
- The Whisper Man's identity
- What's actually imprisoned
- Duergar cult motivations
- Environmental dangers in tunnels
- Long-term threat implications

## Universal Elements (Prepare Regardless)

**Resolution Mechanics**:
- How to prove innocence/guilt
- Rewards from Consortium
- Reputation changes with clans
- Seeds for next module

**Contingency Plans**:
- What if they split the party?
- What if they bring unexpected allies?
- What if they try to combine paths?
- What if they abandon the investigation?

## Between-Session Prep Time: 2-3 hours
Focus only on the chosen path plus universal elements.

## Running Your First Module

### Session 1 Priorities

**Opening Strong** (30 minutes):
- Recap Session Zero briefly
- Jump into Thora's briefing
- Get to forge within 45 minutes
- Keep energy high

**Testing Engagement** (2 hours):
- Note who takes lead in social scenes
- Watch combat tactics and preferences  
- Track investigation methods
- Observe planning time needed

**Clear Cliffhanger** (30 minutes):
- Present three distinct paths
- Each appeals to different play styles
- Let them debate approach
- End immediately after choice

### Session 2 Priorities

**Quick Start** (15 minutes):
- Recap choice made
- Jump to consequences
- Maintain momentum

**Escalating Action** (2.5 hours):
- Build to climax steadily
- Give everyone moments
- Test lessons from Session 1
- Note continuing patterns

**Multiple Endings** (30 minutes):
- Resolve immediate problem
- Show consequences
- Plant future seeds
- Gauge interest directions

### Between Sessions

Analyze Session 1 immediately:
- Which scenes energized players?
- What approaches did they favor?
- Which NPCs sparked interest?
- Where did pacing lag?
- What surprised you?

Adjust Session 2 accordingly:
- Emphasize successful elements
- Minimize draggy parts
- Develop interesting NPCs
- Follow player interests
- Test new variations

## Observation Techniques

### Engagement Tracking

**High Engagement Signs**:
- Leaning forward
- Taking notes
- Asking questions
- Making plans
- Laughing/emotional reactions

**Low Engagement Signs**:
- Checking phones
- Side conversations
- "Whatever you think"
- Long rules discussions
- Bathroom parade

### Decision Analysis

When players make choices, note:
- How long they deliberate
- What factors they consider
- Who influences decisions
- What they worry about
- What excites them

### NPC Response Tracking

For each significant NPC:
- Do players remember their name?
- Do they seek them out?
- Do they reference them later?
- Do they care about their fate?
- Do they want more interaction?

## Common First Module Pitfalls

### Too Ambitious
**Observable Signs**:
- Your notes are 20+ pages for a 2-session module
- You've created 15+ named NPCs with full backstories
- The plot requires players to visit 6+ locations
- You're explaining the villain's motivation for 10 minutes
- Multiple subplots that "might come up"

**Solution**: Cut scope ruthlessly, save ideas for future modules

### Too Linear
**Observable Signs**:
- You panic when players suggest an unexpected approach
- Your notes read like a movie script with specific scenes
- NPCs exist only to deliver specific information
- "They have to talk to Bob first or nothing works"
- Combat encounters that must be won to proceed

**Solution**: Add alternate approaches to every obstacle

### Too Cautious
**Observable Signs**:
- Could swap this into any generic fantasy setting
- No references to your specific campaign world
- "You meet in a tavern and kill rats in the basement"
- Zero connection to the Big Three from Phase 1
- Players asking "Wait, which campaign is this?"

**Solution**: Include at least 3 unique campaign elements

### Too Complex
**Observable Signs**:
- You need a flowchart to explain the plot
- Players constantly ask "Wait, who is that again?"
- The villain's plan requires a 5-step explanation
- Multiple betrayals and counter-betrayals
- Information overload in first 30 minutes

**Solution**: Simple problem, complex implications

### Too Disconnected
**Observable Signs**:
- None of the Session Zero NPCs appear
- New locations instead of established ones
- Ignoring character backstories completely
- Players asking "Why would my character care?"
- Feels like a published module dropped into your world

**Solution**: Use at least 3 elements from Session Zero

## Post-Module Analysis

### Immediate Debrief

Right after Session 2:
- What moments generated excitement?
- Which choices felt meaningful?
- What do players want more of?
- What confused or frustrated them?
- Where do they want to go next?

### Pattern Recognition

From your observations:
- **Combat**: How much? How complex?
- **Social**: Which NPCs work? What tone?
- **Exploration**: How much detail?
- **Pacing**: Faster or slower?
- **Tone**: Lighter or darker?

### Future Direction

Based on results:
- Which plot threads to develop?
- Which NPCs to bring back?
- Which factions to emphasize?
- Which themes resonate?
- Which rules need clarification?

## From First to Second Module

### Applying Lessons

Your second module should:
- Double down on successful elements
- Minimize unsuccessful parts
- Build on established NPCs
- Follow player-indicated interests
- Match discovered pacing preferences

### Expanding Scope

Now you can:
- Plan 3-4 sessions confidently
- Create more complex plots
- Develop deeper NPC relationships
- Build on established facts
- Trust your instincts

### Building Momentum

Use first module success to:
- Generate player investment
- Establish campaign rhythms
- Create recurring elements
- Develop inside jokes
- Build anticipation

## What Makes This Module Work

### Integration Success
Looking at "The Brittle Steel Mystery," notice how it:
- Uses NPCs from Session Zero (Thorek, Lucky Finn, Young Dain)
- Takes place in established locations (Brass Monkey, Foreign Quarter)
- Connects to character interests (magic for Sarah, underworld for Tom)
- Tests different approaches without forcing any single one

### Three-Path Design
Each path appeals to different players:
- **Path A** (Goldbeard): Social and combat, personal drama
- **Path B** (Deepguard): Puzzles and philosophy, magical mystery  
- **Path C** (Tunnels): Stealth and horror, campaign mythology

### Observation Built In
The module naturally reveals:
- Combat preferences (elemental fight)
- Investigation style (forge examination)
- Social approach (Torin interaction)
- Decision making (path choice)
- Pacing preferences (how long they investigate)

### Failure States That Work
If things go wrong:
- Alienate Torin? Break into forge at night
- Kill Dain? Find evidence of innocence
- Ignore everything? Forge explodes at moot
- Take too long? Riots begin

Each failure creates new adventures, not dead ends.

## Putting It All Together

This complete module plan for "The Brittle Steel Mystery" demonstrates:

1. **How to integrate Session Zero elements** (Thorek, Lucky Finn, Brass Monkey)
2. **How to structure for observation** (combat, social, investigation scenes)
3. **How to build in player choice** (three distinct paths)
4. **How to create flexible outcomes** (three different villains)
5. **How to plant campaign seeds** (The Whisper Man, Deep Hunger)

## What You've Created

Following this planning process, you now have:
- Complete session notes for both sessions
- NPC stats and personalities
- Three different module endings
- Observation tools to track preferences
- Seeds for future adventures

## Running This Module

When you run this module:
- Session 1 takes 3-4 hours, ending on the path choice
- Session 2 takes 3-4 hours, resolving based on their decision
- Track which approaches excite players most
- Note which NPCs they connect with
- Observe their preferred pacing

Your second module will build on everything you learn from running this one.
