# Running Your Module

Creating a module is only half the battleâ€”running it effectively requires different skills. This chapter covers session management during modules, handling the unexpected, and smoothly transitioning between modules.

## Session Management During Modules

### Pre-Session Rituals

**15 Minutes Before Start**:
- Review session outline and key NPCs
- Check previous session notes
- Prepare initiative trackers
- Queue music/ambiance
- Set out maps/handouts

**Session Opening Routine**:
1. Recap previous session (or ask a player to)
2. Address any between-session actions
3. Set the scene with strong imagery
4. Ask a leading question to engage players
5. Begin with action or decision

### Pacing Within Sessions

**The Heartbeat Method**:
- **Action** (combat, chase, intense negotiation)
- **Breathing Room** (exploration, planning, roleplay)
- **Action** (different type than before)
- **Reflection** (process events, make plans)
- **Cliffhanger** (set up next session)

**Time Management Tools**:
- Set phone timer for scene transitions
- Use "camera cuts" to skip dead time
- "Montage" repetitive activities
- Call for breaks at natural stopping points
- End on time with cliffhanger

**Reading the Room**:
- Energy dropping? Add immediate threat
- Too much combat? Introduce social challenge
- Players confused? NPC provides clarity
- Rushing through? Add complication
- Overthinking? Force time pressure

### Mid-Module Adjustments

**After Each Session, Evaluate**:
- Are players engaged with the main plot?
- Which NPCs resonate most?
- What unexpected directions emerged?
- Is pacing too fast/slow?
- Do stakes still feel meaningful?

**Common Adjustments**:

**Module Too Short**:
- Add subplot from player backstory
- Complicate existing challenge
- Introduce rival party
- Expand travel/exploration
- Deepen NPC relationships

**Module Too Long**:
- Cut planned encounters
- Combine multiple NPCs
- Accelerate timeline
- Skip to dramatic moments
- Resolve subplots quickly

**Players Off-Track**:
- Move important content to where they're going
- Have NPCs seek them out
- Create consequences that redirect
- Embrace new direction if interesting
- Use cliffhangers to refocus

### Managing Module Resources

**Information Flow**:
- Track what players know vs. assume
- Note which clues they've found
- Mark which NPCs they've met
- Record their current theories
- Plan next information reveals

**NPC Management**:
- Keep voice/mannerism notes handy
- Track relationship changes
- Note promises made/broken
- Update NPC goals based on events
- Plan NPC actions between sessions

**Continuity Tracking**:
- Maintain timeline of events
- Note resource expenditure
- Track faction reputation
- Record environment changes
- Update maps as explored

## Handling Derailments

### Types of Derailments

**The Murder Hobo**:
**Observable Signs**:
- "I attack the questgiver"
- Violence as first solution to every problem
- Killing NPCs mid-conversation
- No interest in NPC names or motivations
- "Are there any witnesses?"

**Solution**: Information has backups, consequences follow

**The Speedrun**:
**Observable Signs**:
- "We fly directly to the boss"
- Skipping all investigation/preparation
- Meta-gaming with player knowledge
- "Can we just roll to solve this?"
- Avoiding all optional content

**Solution**: Complications arise from shortcuts

**The Turtle**:
**Observable Signs**:
- 2-hour planning for 10-minute task
- Analysis paralysis over simple decisions
- "But what if..." spirals
- Drawing elaborate plans nobody follows
- Sessions ending with no progress

**Solution**: World moves without them

**The Revolt**:
**Observable Signs**:
- "Why would we help them?"
- Active opposition to every plot hook
- Trying to join the villain
- "This is stupid" comments
- Complete disengagement from premise

**Solution**: Find what they want instead

### Derailment Recovery Tools

**The Quantum Ogre**:
Important content appears wherever players go, reskinned to fit

**The Consequence Cascade**:
Their choices create new problems requiring attention

**The Rival Party**:
Other adventurers pursue missed opportunities

**The Timeline Pressure**:
Events happen with or without PC involvement

**The Mirror Match**:
Their approach creates opposite reaction

### When to Abandon Module

**Clear Signals with Observable Signs**:

**Consistent Player Disengagement**:
- Phones out more than dice
- "Are we almost done?" every session
- Cancellations increasing
- No between-session discussion
- Forgetting major plot points

**Fundamental Premise Rejection**:
- "I don't care about saving the town"
- Actively working against module goals
- Creating their own unrelated objectives
- "Can we do something else instead?"
- Zero investment in NPCs or stakes

**Real-World Circumstances Changed**:
- Lost half the players
- Session length cut dramatically
- Tone mismatch with group mood
- External stress affecting game
- Schedule no longer works

**Better Opportunity Emerged**:
- Players obsessed with throwaway detail
- Side quest generating more excitement
- Character backstory taking center stage
- "Can we explore that instead?"
- Natural story evolution demands it

**Module No Longer Serves Campaign**:
- Original purpose obsolete
- Stakes resolved differently
- Characters outgrew challenges
- Tone shifted dramatically
- Better conclusion available

**Graceful Exits**:
- Resolve current scene/session
- Summarize remaining events
- Extract useful elements
- Transition to player interests
- Mine module for future content

## Module Transitions

### Ending Strong

**Final Session Elements**:
- Climactic confrontation/resolution
- Immediate consequences shown
- Loose ends addressed (or noted)
- Rewards distributed
- Future hooks planted

**The Debrief**:
- What worked well?
- Favorite moments?
- Unresolved interests?
- Character development?
- Campaign direction preferences?

### Between Modules

**Downtime Activities**:
- Let players pursue personal goals
- Advance background events
- Heal wounds/restore resources
- Develop relationships
- Foreshadow next module

**Campaign Housekeeping**:
- Update character sheets
- Resolve advancement
- Distribute rewards
- Note reputation changes
- Plan next arc

### Connecting Modules

**Direct Connection**:
- Cliffhanger leads immediately to next module
- Same antagonist in new situation
- Consequences require immediate action

**Indirect Connection**:
- Time passes between modules
- New threat emerges from victory
- Different location but connected theme

**Anthology Connection**:
- Modules share world but not direct plot
- Recurring NPCs provide continuity
- Themes echo across adventures

## Common Running Challenges

### Challenge: Split Party

**Observable Signs**:
- Half the table sitting silent while others play
- Players pulling out phones during other group's scenes
- "Are we done yet?" body language
- Scenes taking 20+ minutes per group
- Players forgetting what the other group is doing

**Solutions**:
- Run concurrent short scenes (5-10 minutes max)
- Create external reuniting force
- Use cliffhangers to build tension
- Have NPCs coordinate reunion
- Let split create interesting complications

### Challenge: Rules Arguments

**Observable Signs**:
- Same rule discussion lasting >5 minutes
- Multiple players looking up rules on phones
- Heated voices or defensive postures
- Other players disengaging from the argument
- "But that's not realistic!" or "The book says..."

**Solutions**:
- Make quick ruling, research later
- Let player make case (30 seconds)
- Roll for edge cases
- Note for between-session resolution
- Keep game moving forward

### Challenge: Absent Players

**Observable Signs**:
- Last-minute "can't make it" texts
- Regular pattern of specific player missing
- Other players asking "Where's [Name]?"
- Story momentum stalling without key character
- Combat balance thrown off

**Solutions**:
- NPC their character minimally
- Character has other mission
- Mysterious disappearance (if dramatic)
- Other player runs them in combat
- Adjust difficulty accordingly

### Challenge: Energy Mismatch

**Observable Signs**:
- One player super excited while others look tired
- Joking/sidebar conversations during serious scenes
- Players wanting different scene types ("More combat!" vs "More roleplay!")
- Physical restlessness (getting up frequently, fidgeting)
- Mismatched expectations ("I thought this was a silly game")

**Solutions**:
- Call break to reset
- Switch activity type
- Engage different players
- Acknowledge and address directly
- Consider early session end

## Module Success Metrics
