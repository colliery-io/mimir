## The Three Binders Pattern

1. **Campaign Binder** - Created during Integration stage
2. **Module Binder** - Created during Development stage  
3. **Session Binder** - Created during Ready stage

Each binder contains the documents created at that board level.

## Key Rules

- You don't touch Module Board until after Session Zero
- You don't touch Session Board until you have a module Ready
- Campaign Board tracks big picture (whole campaign)
- Module Board tracks story arcs (3-6 sessions)
- Session Board tracks individual games
