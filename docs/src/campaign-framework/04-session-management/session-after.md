# Post-Session & Campaign Continuity

The 30 minutes after a session shapes the next one. Here's how to capture momentum and maintain campaign continuity.

## Immediate Capture (10 minutes)

Right after players leave, write:

### What Happened
```
Ironhold Session 2 - Deepguard Archive:
- Interrupted Morak's ritual (Lisa's diplomacy)
- Discovered his mistranslation of ancient texts
- Tom examined books, triggered translation revelation
- Fought animated armor guardian (Marcus got spotlight)
- Found Goldbeard conspiracy letter
- Performed emergency stabilization ritual (whole party)
- Bought 3 days before seal fails (maybe less)
```

### Player Reactions
```
- Lisa: Proud of converting Morak peacefully
- Marcus: Happy about armor fight, wants more
- Tom: Excited about Goldbeard conspiracy
- Sarah: Finally got spotlight in stabilization ritual!
- All: Relief at buying time, but worried about what's next
```

### Dangling Threads
```
- Stabilization could fail any time (roll secretly?)
- Goldbeards have one key-stone, 3-week head start
- Need all three keys for permanent solution
- Two other seals location known but status unknown
- Counter-ritual requirements still unclear
- Other cities having similar problems
```

### DM Notes
```
- Guardian's disadvantage roll worked perfectly
- Environmental attack gave Marcus early action
- Books as props paid off in revelation
- Stabilization ritual gave everyone a moment
- Good stopping point - crisis resolved but threat remains
- Secret rolls for seal stability could add tension
```

## The Week After (20 minutes Monday)

Transform notes into improvements:

### What Worked
- Opening mid-crisis grabbed attention
- Books as Chekhov's gun for revelation
- Guardian disadvantage created "natural" combat
- Environmental attack for Marcus
- Cliffhanger with everyone engaged

### What Didn't
- Sarah present but not central to action
- Could have used the glyph trap
- Pacing rushed at the end
- Didn't clarify counter-ritual needs

### Next Session Needs
- Let players choose direction (research/pursue/explore)
- Continue Sarah's momentum from ritual success
- More combat opportunities for Marcus
- Clarify key-stone mechanics
- Secret stability rolls behind screen

### Chaos Monkey Mechanic
Every in-game hour, roll d20 secretly:
- 1: Seal weakens noticeably (describe environmental signs)
- 2-19: Holds steady
- 20: Actually strengthens slightly (stabilization working better than expected)

## Continuity Management

### The Living World

In the hour since the ritual was interrupted:

```
Immediate Reactions:
- Guards rushing to archive (tremor was felt)
- Acolytes fled when ritual went wrong
- Temperature dropping near the cracks
- Whispers audible to those who listen closely
- Morak frantically searching for counter-ritual
```

### NPC Actions (Next Hour)
While party heads to Sunken Seal:
- **Torin**: Won't know what happened yet
- **Morak**: Searching archives for correct ritual
- **Grimnar Goldbeard**: Unknown location (letter was 3 weeks old)
- **City Guard Captain**: Demanding explanations
- **Citizens**: Starting to panic about the cold

### Unknown Factors
- Where are the Goldbeards now?
- Do they know the seal cracked?
- Who else felt the tremor?
- Is anyone else racing to the seals?

### Timeline Tracking
```
Day 1: Brittle steel discovered
Day 2 Morning: Met Torin at forge (Session 1)
Day 2 Afternoon: Archive crisis, stabilization ritual (Session 2)
Day 2 Evening: [Party can rest, plan, research]
Day 3-4: [Available for next module]
Day 5: Clan moot deadline

Current time: ~3 PM, Day 2
Stabilization duration: 3 days (maybe less - DM rolls secretly)
```

## Campaign Tools

### The Continuity Doc

One document tracking:
```
ESTABLISHED FACTS:
- Whisper Man imprisoned below
- Forge guardian 800 years old
- Three seals keeping evil trapped
- Morak trying to help

PLAYER THEORIES:

- Lisa: Religious corruption
- Sarah: Ancient curse
- Marcus: Clan sabotage

COMMITMENTS MADE:
- Help Morak with ritual
- Report to Thora in 2 days
- Keep Goldbeards innocent
- Protect the seals
```

### Consequence Tracking

Every choice creates ripples:

```
Interrupted Ritual Instead of Watching:
- Seal only cracked, not shattered (+)
- Morak survived to help (+)
- Learned about threat in time (+)
- Whisper Man now stirring (-)

Stabilization Ritual Success:
- Everyone contributed to solution (+)
- Bought 3 days to plan (+)
- Sarah got key spotlight moment (+)
- Temporary fix only (-)
- Could fail at any moment (-)

Future Impact:
- Morak actively researching proper ritual
- Party can plan instead of panic
- Multiple paths available (research/pursue/explore)
- Secret stability rolls create tension
- Clear transition point for next module
```

## Between Modules

### Downtime Activities

Let players pursue personal goals:
- **Sarah**: Research at library
- **Marcus**: Training guards
- **Tom**: Underworld contacts
- **Lisa**: Temple services

Quick resolution:
"Sarah, you find three references to similar seal failures. All ended badly."

### Background Events

Roll or choose:
1. Rival party succeeds/fails
2. Political shift occurs
3. NPC needs help
4. Threat grows stronger
5. Opportunity expires
6. New faction arrives

## Metrics That Matter

### Energy Levels
- Post-game chatter = success
- Immediate departure = problem
- Between-session texts = very engaged

### Story Progress
- Threads resolving = good pacing
- Threads multiplying = slow down
- Threads ignored = refocus

## Common Pitfalls

### "I Forgot What Happened"
**Example**: Three weeks later, you can't remember if Morak knows about the Goldbeards.

**Fix**: Start with player recap: "Who remembers what we discovered last time?"
- Player: "We found out Morak was doing a ritual..."
- You: "Right! And you found that letter about the Goldbeards having a key."
- Your notes fill gaps: "Morak was horrified when he realized his mistake"

### "Continuity Errors"
**Example**: You say Grimnar Goldbeard is at the Sunken Seal, but the letter said they were going to the Eastern Mountains.

**Fix**: "You're right. Let's say the letter mentioned multiple seal locations—they could be at any of them." Turn the mistake into mystery.

### "Too Many Threads"
**Example**: You're tracking:
- Brittle steel crisis
- Whisper Man threat
- Goldbeard conspiracy
- Clan politics
- Torin's family drama
- City guard investigation
- Other cities' problems

**Fix**: Let some resolve off-screen:
- "News arrives: The neighboring city found a temporary fix for their steel"
- "Torin sends word—his daughter Thora discovered something but needs time to verify"
- Keep focus on immediate threat (seals) while others simmer

### "Nothing Feels Connected"
**Example**: Players feel like random things keep happening with no throughline.

**Fix**: Show connections explicitly:
- "The tremor you caused at the archive? The Goldbeards felt it at the second seal."
- "Remember that brittle steel? Now you know why—the seals weakening affects the forge's divine blessing."
- "Morak's mistranslation? Turns out three other cities made the same error."

Make coincidences feel like conspiracy, random events feel orchestrated.

## Sustainable Practices

### The 80/20 Rule
- 80% of continuity comes from 20% of details
- Track what matters, forget the rest
- Names and promises matter most
- Exact words rarely matter

### Tools Not Memory
- Write it down immediately
- Use templates consistently
- Reference sheets during play
- Players help track too

### Campaign Health Check

Monthly questions:
1. Are players still excited?
2. Is the story progressing?
3. Am I enjoying this?
4. What needs adjustment?
5. Where are we heading?

## Prep Self-Assessment

After a few sessions, you'll notice patterns in your preparation style. Here's how to recognize and adjust:

**Signs You're Over-Preparing:**
You spent three hours detailing the archive's history, but the session ended with unused pages of notes. Players solved the Morak situation in an unexpected way, and you felt frustrated about "wasted" work. If you regularly finish sessions with 70%+ of your prep untouched, shift focus from creating content to preparing flexible tools—NPC motivations over monologues, situation dynamics over scripted scenes.

**Signs You're Under-Preparing:**
You found yourself stalling multiple times, frantically flipping through books for stats, or making up critical plot details that contradict earlier sessions. If players frequently catch continuity errors or you're exhausted from constant improvisation, you need more structure. The one-page plan isn't restrictive—it's your safety net for confident improvisation.

**Signs You're Too Rigid:**
You feel anxiety when players make unexpected choices. You find yourself steering conversations back to your planned scenes. Players comment that outcomes feel predetermined. If deviation from your prep causes panic rather than excitement, practice preparing multiple branches rather than single paths. Think "if/then" scenarios rather than story beats.

## Moving Forward

Each session builds your campaign:
- Immediate notes capture momentum
- Weekly analysis improves play
- Continuity tools maintain coherence
- Regular check-ins ensure health

The campaign is a living thing. These practices keep it thriving.

## Summary

Post-session work takes 30 minutes:
- 10 minutes immediate capture
- 20 minutes weekly analysis
- Ongoing: simple tracking tools

This investment pays dividends in campaign coherence and player engagement. Your future self will thank you.
