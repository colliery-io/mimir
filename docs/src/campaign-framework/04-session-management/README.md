# Session Management

Running great sessions consistently transforms a campaign from a series of games into an unforgettable story. Session management breaks down into three distinct phases, each requiring different skills and techniques.

## The Three Phases

Every game session involves:

### [Pre-Session Preparation](./session-before.md)
The week between sessions determines success. Learn the weekly workflow that turns one hour of focused prep into four hours of engaging play. Covers everything from post-game notes through your pre-game ritual.

### [Running the Session](./session-during.md)
Where preparation meets improvisation. Master the techniques for strong openings, reading the room, managing different player types, and landing satisfying cliffhangers. Your guide to 3-4 hours of actual play.

### [Post-Session & Campaign Continuity](./session-after.md)
The 30 minutes after a session shapes the next one. Capture what matters, track the living world, and maintain campaign momentum. Plus tools for managing continuity without drowning in notes.

## Core Principles

**One hour of prep creates four hours of play** - if you prep the right things.

**The world moves without the players** - NPCs pursue goals, events unfold, consequences ripple.

**Tools over memory** - Simple tracking systems beat trying to remember everything.

**Energy management matters** - Both yours and your players' energy must be sustained.

## Start Here

To see these principles in action, we'll follow a complete example throughout this section:

**[Interlude: Session 1 Play-Through](./session-interlude.md)** - See what happened in Session 1 of our Brittle Steel mystery, establishing the foundation we'll build on in our prep examples.

New DMs: After reading the interlude, begin with [Pre-Session Preparation](./session-before.md) to build sustainable habits.

Experienced DMs: Jump to whichever phase challenges you most, though the interlude provides helpful context.

The three phases work togetherâ€”master all three for consistently excellent sessions.
