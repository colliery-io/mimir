# Interlude: Session 1 Play-Through

*Before we dive into the mechanics of session management, let's see what actually happened in Session 1 that sets up our Session 2 planning example.*

## The Brittle Steel Mystery Begins

### Opening Scene: The Broken Blade

The party gathered at the Bronze Dragon Inn in Greyhold, each drawn by different threads—Marcus seeking redemption through heroic deeds, Thora investigating unusual ore shipments, Elara following whispers of ancient magic, and Torin simply needing honest work.

Their separate purposes converged when Garrett the innkeeper demonstrated his problem: a two-month-old sword that crumbled like chalk when struck against his cutting board. "Third one this week," he muttered. "The smith swears his technique hasn't changed, but the steel..."

**What the Players Did:**
- Thora immediately examined the metal (Investigation: 18), noting crystalline patterns she'd never seen
- Elara detected faint traces of corrupted magic (Arcana: 21)
- Marcus interviewed the angry customer, learning this affected the town guard's weapons
- Torin offered to speak with the local smiths, having worked with many

### Investigation: The Smith's Confession

At the Hammer & Tongs, they found Brendan the smith near tears. His demonstration was dramatic—a freshly forged horseshoe shattered when dropped. "It's not just my work," he confided. "Every smith in town. Started eight weeks ago. The metal's cursed, I tell you."

The party learned:
- The brittle steel problem began suddenly
- All iron from the Irondeep Mines was affected
- The Miners' Guild was staying suspiciously quiet
- Shipments were still going out to neighboring towns (Thora was alarmed by this)

**Player Theories Emerged:**
- Marcus: "Sabotage by enemies of Greyhold"
- Thora: "Someone's poisoning the ore supply"
- Elara: "This corruption feels ancient, not recent"
- Torin: "The miners know more than they're saying"

### The Goldbeard Connection

Their investigation led to the Miners' Guildhall, where they encountered Goldbeard—a red-bearded dwarf who clearly hadn't expected visitors. His nervous energy peaked when Thora mentioned she was a weapons merchant.

"The mines are closed!" he blurted. "Official guild business. No visitors. The iron's fine, just a bad batch. We're handling it internally." His protests rang hollow.

When pressed, Goldbeard let slip: "If you think you can do better than us, talk to Morak yourself! He's the only one who... I mean..." He clamped his mouth shut, but the damage was done.

### Choice Point: Three Paths

The party faced a decision on how to pursue Morak:

1. **The Official Route**: Request formal permission from the Miners' Guild
2. **The Stealthy Approach**: Sneak into the closed mines
3. **The Research Path**: Investigate the Deepguard Archive first

After debate (and Elara's strong advocacy for knowledge before action), they chose the Archive. Torin's practical nature won out: "Better to know what we're walking into."

### The Deepguard Archive

Sister Catherine, the archive keeper, granted them access to the restricted historical section after Elara demonstrated her sincere scholarly interest (and the party donated to the temple).

Hours of research revealed:
- **Ancient records**: References to "deep seals" and "imprisoned corruption"
- **Dwarven texts**: Warnings about "that which gnaws at the world's bones"
- **Recent logs**: Morak had been here six weeks ago, reading the same texts
- **A crucial map**: Showing old sealed tunnels in the Irondeep Mines

Thora discovered margin notes in Morak's handwriting: "The ancestors were wrong. Containment is not purification. The corruption must be released to be cleansed."

### Cliffhanger: Into the Depths

Armed with knowledge and growing concern, the party decided to enter the mines immediately. At the supposedly sealed entrance, they found:
- Fresh footprints despite the "closed" status
- The seal broken from the inside
- Echoes of chanting from deep below
- A faint, rhythmic pulsing of purple light

As they descended into the darkness, Elara's magical senses screamed warnings. The corruption wasn't just in the iron—it permeated the very air. Somewhere below, Morak was attempting something that had been forbidden for centuries.

The session ended with the party at the threshold of the ancient section, purple light growing stronger, and the sound of Morak's voice raised in ritual chant: "Rise, corruption! Show them their steel is as weak as their faith!"

- The Miners' Guild has significant autonomy
- Ancient dwarven ruins exist beneath current mines
- The Deepguard Archive preserves dangerous knowledge

### Character Moments
- Marcus established himself as the face of the party
- Thora's merchant connections provided context
- Elara's scholarly approach opened doors
- Torin's practical wisdom guided decisions

### Mystery Elements
- **The Problem**: Brittle steel threatening the economy
- **The Suspect**: Morak, driven by corrupted logic
- **The Truth**: Ancient sealed corruption being "released to cleanse"
- **The Stakes**: A town's survival and possibly more

### Player Engagement
The players showed clear interest in:
- The historical mystery (especially Elara's player)
