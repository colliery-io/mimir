**Weekly Rhythm:**
- T+1 Morning: Capture session notes (20 min)
- T+1 Evening: Process notes + Module check (30 min total)
- T-3: Full session prep (60-90 min)
- Optional T-5: Player communication (15 min)

## Critical Decision Points

**"When do I create my first module?"**
- AFTER Session Zero, not before
- Based on actual PCs and player interests
- Short (2 sessions) to test preferences

**"When do I start the next module?"**
- When current module has 2 sessions remaining
- Move from Backlog → Planning immediately
- Complete before current module ends

**"What if players derail everything?"**
- Capture what excited them (T+1)
- Add new module ideas to Backlog
- Natural selection: develop what they engage with
