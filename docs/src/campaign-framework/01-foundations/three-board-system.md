# The Three-Board System

## Overview: Organizing Creative Chaos

The Three-Board System transforms campaign management from mental juggling to physical organization. Inspired by agile project management and kanban workflows, it creates a visual, tactile system for tracking your campaign's past, present, and future.

Whether implemented physically with actual boards and index cards or digitally with folders and files, the system provides clear information architecture that reduces cognitive load and improves creative flow.

## The Three Organizational Levels

The system uses three distinct levels—Campaign, Module, and Session—each serving a specific purpose in your workflow. Think of it simply: big picture, current arc, and next game.


## Campaign Board 
---
**Time Horizon**: Entire campaign arc  
**Review Cycle**: Monthly  
**Purpose**: Track overarching narrative and long-term developments

This board tracks the readiness and lifecycle of campaign-level elements. The Campaign board manages:

- Campaign documentation readiness
- Player character integration status

## How the Boards Work Together

The three boards create a natural workflow that pulls information where it's needed, when it's needed. Here's how it works in practice:

### Starting from Zero

You've got a group of friends who want to play D&D, and you've offered to DM. Your Campaign board starts empty, but ideas begin flowing onto cards in the Concept column: "Dragon Civil War," "The Last Gods," "The Imprisoned Corruption." You share these sparks with your players over coffee, gauging reactions. Their eyes light up at the mention of ancient evils and dwarven ruins—"The Imprisoned Corruption" it is.

The card moves to Session Zero on your Campaign board. You create your first Campaign Binder documents: a Campaign Pitch that captures the dark fantasy tone, and a Starting Scenario describing the mining town of Greyhold. When your players create their characters—Marcus the paladin seeking redemption, Thora the dwarven merchant, Elara the scholar-wizard, and Torin the veteran fighter—these become new cards moving into Integration. You're building a living world around their choices.

### Campaign to Module Flow

Session Zero was two weeks ago. Your players are excited, characters are built, and everyone's ready to discover what "The Imprisoned Corruption" means. Your Campaign board shows cards in Active: the overarching threat, three player character arcs, and the Ironhold setting. Time to create your first module.

You grab a card and write "The Brittle Steel Mystery." This opening module needs to accomplish several things: introduce the corruption threat without revealing everything, give each character a reason to care, and establish Ironhold as worth saving. You move it to Planning on your Module board.

Opening your Campaign Binder, you pull what you need: the corruption theme, the sealed evil that mustn't escape, the promise of heroes preventing catastrophe. These Campaign-level truths shape your module planning—the players will discover a local mystery that's actually the first symptom of something vast.

Through the week, you develop the module. By week's end, when you move it to Ready on your Module board, your Module Binder contains everything needed to run "The Brittle Steel Mystery." The important part isn't the creation process—it's that your Module board shows you exactly when to start the next one.

This is how campaigns maintain momentum: When your current module has two sessions left, that's your trigger. You'll move a new idea from Backlog to Planning, opening your Campaign Binder again to ensure the next arc connects to your larger story. The boards create a natural rhythm where you're always developing tomorrow's content while running today's game.

But where do those Backlog ideas come from? Everywhere. During play, Marcus makes an offhand comment about his sister—card goes in Backlog: "The Paladin's Lost Sister." Sarah theorizes the Goldbeards are working for dragons—another card: "Dragon Conspiracy?" You have a nightmare about clockwork horrors—card: "The Brass Automation." Player interests, genre inspiration, shower thoughts—capture them all. These half-formed ideas don't need to be perfect. When you need a new module, you'll have a rich collection to choose from, each one already sparked by something that excited you or your players.

### Module to Session Pull

Your first module is ready. "The Brittle Steel Mystery" sits in the Ready column of your Module board, your Module Binder contains four sessions worth of content, and your players are arriving tomorrow for Session 1. Time to see how the system handles actual play.

It's T-3 days before game night. Your Session board shows a card in Next Week: "Session 1: The Gathering Storm." You move it to Prep Needed—this triggers your weekly session prep ritual. But here's the beautiful part: you're not creating anything new. You're pulling from work already done.

You open your Module Binder to the Brittle Steel Mystery section. Everything for Session 1 is there: the opening scene in the Rusty Anvil tavern, three ways the characters might meet, the panicked smith who bursts in with broken tools. Your 8-step prep process isn't about creation—it's about selection and customization. Which opening best fits your group? How will you voice the panicked smith? What if they ignore the obvious hook?

As you prep, you realize Torin's player mentioned wanting family in town. Nothing in your module prevents this—in fact, it's perfect. You make a note: the panicked smith is Torin's cousin. This doesn't require reaching up to Campaign level; it's a session-level detail that enriches the module content. You jot it on an index card for your Session Binder.

Game night arrives. Session 1 unfolds beautifully—the party investigates, theorizes, and decides to check the Deepguard Archive. Perfect. This is exactly one of the three paths your module anticipated. The next morning (T+1), you update your Session board: move Session 1 to Complete, capture notes about player theories (Tom thinks it's sabotage, Sarah suspects magic). 

T-3 days comes again. Time to prep Session 2. The card moves from Next Week to Prep Needed, you open your Module Binder, and there it is—the Deepguard Archive section, ready to go. The system keeps you ahead of your players while leaving room for their choices to matter.

### The Complete Circuit

Game night generates new information. The party saved Morak but couldn't prevent the seal from cracking. Sara's character revealed she can read ancient dwarven—a surprise that needs tracking. The party decided to seek out the remaining seals immediately rather than returning to town. 

The next morning (T+1), these session outcomes flow back up. You update your Module documentation with the seal's status and the party's chosen direction. This module will likely wrap next session—earlier than expected. At the Module level, you move "The Second Seal" from Ready to Active, knowing you need to accelerate that prep.

When month's end comes, your Campaign review shows the pattern. The Imprisoned Corruption arc has driven three successful modules. Marcus's player specifically mentioned how the corruption theme resonates with his redemption arc. You update your Campaign documentation, adding notes about how each seal's breaking should escalate the visible effects. The circuit is complete: Campaign priorities shaped Module selection, Modules provided Session content, Sessions generated outcomes that updated Modules, and Module completions informed Campaign evolution.

When everything clicks, the system becomes invisible. You're not managing boards—you're running a living campaign where every level supports the others.

### Feedback Loops: Information Flowing Back Up

The Three-Board System isn't just about pulling content down—it's about pushing discoveries back up. Every session generates information that needs to flow upward through your system.

**Session → Module Flow** (What happened affects the current arc):
During Session 3, the players completely ignored the merchant quarter and spent two hours investigating the abandoned mine instead. They're convinced the corruption originates underground. This session-level discovery flows up to your Module board: add a card to Development for "The Forgotten Shafts" location. Their interest just wrote your Session 5.

**Session → Campaign Flow** (What happened affects everything):
Tom's wizard just used a spell in a creative way that shattered your assumptions about magic in this world. This isn't just a session note—it flows all the way up to Campaign. You update your magic system notes in the Campaign Binder. Every future module will incorporate this new understanding. Player creativity just enriched your entire world.

**Module → Campaign Flow** (Completed arcs shape the future):
"The Brittle Steel Mystery" is complete. The party saved Ironhold but made enemies of the Goldbeard clan in the process. This module outcome flows up to Campaign level: move "Goldbeard Revenge" from Concept to Active. Create a new card: "Merchant Guild Politics." What started as a local mystery has reshaped your campaign's political landscape.

**Player Interest Signals** (The most important feedback):
Session 2: Sarah mentions her merchant character should have contacts in other cities.
Session 4: She asks specifically about trade routes to Ironpeak.
Session 6: She wants to send a message to her factor there.

This pattern flows up through every level. At Module: your next arc features Ironpeak. At Campaign: you develop the Merchant Guild as a major faction. Sarah's interests are writing your campaign.

**The Extreme Pivots** (When players change everything):
Your grimdark political intrigue suddenly becomes a comedy of errors when the players adopt a goblin and open a restaurant. This isn't a failure—it's feedback. The signal flows up instantly:
- Session level: Add cooking mechanics to tomorrow's prep
- Module level: Scrap "The Duke's Assassination," develop "The Grand Opening"
- Campaign level: Archive political intrigue notes, expand the merchant/craft guild systems

The boards don't lock you into a path—they help you pivot gracefully when your players show you what game they want to play.

**Natural Selection for Modules**:
Your Backlog has fifteen module ideas. Which ones get developed? The ones your players lean toward:
- They loved investigating? "The Brass Automation Mystery" moves to Planning
- They avoided all combat? "The Gladiator Uprising" stays in Backlog forever
- They befriended the villain? "Redemption of the Whisper Cult" just got created

Player engagement naturally selects which modules get made. Your campaign evolves to match what excites your table.

**Weekly Upward Flow Checklist**:
T+1 post-session:
- What surprised me? → Update Module assumptions
- What excited them? → Add to Module Backlog
- What changed permanently? → Update Campaign docs

This upward flow ensures your campaign remains alive and responsive. The players aren't just experiencing your world—they're creating it with you.

## Review Cadences

The system works because you touch it regularly. Not lengthy planning sessions—quick, focused check-ins that keep everything flowing.

**T+1 Morning** (20 minutes post-session):
The morning after game night, while it's fresh. Move cards on your Session board to Complete. Capture what happened, what surprised you, what the players loved. These notes feed everything else. Don't analyze yet—just record.

**T-3 Days** (60-90 minutes):
Session prep time. Move next session from Next Week to Prep Needed. Pull from your Module and Campaign binders as needed. This isn't creation time—it's assembly and customization. By the end, move your session to Ready.

**Weekly Module Check** (10 minutes):
Usually T+1 evening. Quick glance: How many sessions left in current module? Anything need to bubble up to Campaign level? Any Backlog ideas ready to move to Planning? This prevents the "Oh no, my module ends next week and I have nothing planned" panic.

**Monthly Campaign Review** (30 minutes):
Once per month. Are player arcs getting spotlight time? Has the campaign drifted from its core themes? What Background elements should activate? This is when you zoom out and see the forest, not just the trees.

## Success Indicators

You know the Three-Board System is working when:

- **Prep flows smoothly**: Pull from Module board, populate Session board
- **Sessions feel connected**: Clear throughlines between games
- **Players notice continuity**: Their actions have visible consequences
- **Cognitive load drops**: Less mental juggling during sessions
- **Creativity increases**: More mental space for improvisation



### The Weekly Pull Cycle

**T+30m ** (Post-Session):
- Session ends with cliffhanger: "The seal is cracking!"
- Capture in Session board: Player choices, NPC reactions
- This naturally **pulls** you to check: What's on the Module board about seals?

**T+1** (Module Review):
- Module board shows: "Ancient seals" thread is now active
- Check Campaign board: "The Imprisoned Corruption" is a major arc
- **Pull** Campaign info down → Update Module board with seal consequences

**T-3** (Session Prep):
- Need to prep for game night
- **Pull** from Module board: Active threads, NPC motivations
- **Pull** specific details: Morak's stats, seal mechanics, countdown timer
- Everything flows naturally to your Session board

### The Natural Rhythm

After 3-4 weeks, the pull mechanics become automatic:

1. **Session Prep pulls from Module**: "I need NPCs and locations for game night"
2. **Module Review pulls from Campaign**: "How does this fit the bigger picture?"
3. **Campaign Review pulls from everything**: "What patterns are emerging?"

You stop asking "What should I prep?" and start asking "What do I need for this specific situation?"—the boards have the answer.

### Signs It's Working

- You check boards for answers, not obligation
- Prep feels like assembly, not creation
- Players notice consequences spanning sessions
- You can explain any NPC's motivation instantly
- Campaign events feel inevitable, not forced



## Next Steps
