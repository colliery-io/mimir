<pre><code class="language-markdown"># Starting Scenario: The Ironhold Job

## Where You Are
You've been in Ironhold's Foreign Quarter for two weeks. The Brass Monkey 
Tavern has become your unofficial headquarters—it's where outsiders gather, 
deals are made, and news flows freely. The dwarven city around you feels 
tense, but in the Foreign Quarter, your kind are welcome enough.

## Recent Events
Over the past two weeks, several incidents have made you known in the Foreign 
Quarter. You might have been involved in one or more of these:

- **The Market Brawl**: Clan warriors fought in the streets. Some helped 
  evacuate civilians (including young Dain Brightstone), others looted abandoned 
  stalls, a few just watched and took notes.

- **The Brass Monkey Incident**: A rigged dice game nearly sparked a riot. 
  Whether you exposed the cheat, were the cheat, or helped calm things down, 
  people remember.

- **The Warehouse Job**: Someone tried organizing freelancers for a "simple" 
  theft from a Goldbeard warehouse. It went badly. Were you the mastermind, 
  hired muscle, or the one who walked away when it smelled wrong?

Whatever your involvement, you've noticed others who handle themselves well 
when things go sideways. The Foreign Quarter is small—competent outsiders 
recognize each other.

## The Opportunity
This morning, a well-dressed dwarf delivered messages to each of you:

*"Merchant Guildmaster Thora Brightstone requests your presence at the 
Brass Monkey Tavern tonight at sunset. Come prepared for immediate employment. 
Discretion required. Payment generous."*

You know Brightstone by reputation—she runs the Merchant Consortium, one of 
the few organizations in Ironhold that stays neutral in clan politics. If 
she's hiring outsiders, she needs something done that clan dwarves can't or 
won't do.

## What to Consider
- What brought you to Ironhold in the first place?
- What skills do you have that dwarven clans might lack?
- Which recent events were you involved in, and how?
- What would make you take a dangerous job in a foreign city?

## Practical Details
**Starting Situation**: Established in Foreign Quarter, known as competent
**Resources**: Standard starting equipment plus 50gp from recent work
**Meeting Point**: The Brass Monkey Tavern, tonight at sunset

The adventure begins when you decide what to do about Brightstone's invitation.

<pre><code class="language-markdown"># Welcome to Ironhold
*Last of the Great Dwarven Cities*

## What Everyone Knows

### The City
Ironhold stands alone—the last dwarven city-state to survive the Dragon Wars. 
Built into Mount Karathak, it has endured for over 2,000 years through 
legendary craftsmanship and five great clan-forges that never cool.

Population: ~500,000 (60% dwarves, 20% humans, 10% halflings, 10% other)

### The Districts You'll Navigate
- **Foreign Quarter**: Where you're staying. Neutral ground, clan law doesn't apply
- **Market District**: Open during daylight, controlled by Goldbeard clan
- **Forge District**: Industrial heart, restricted access, dominated by Fireforge
- **Clan Quarters**: Five separate districts, each with own laws and customs
- **Royal Quarter**: Seat of (empty) power, heavily guarded by all clans
- **Undertown**: The depths where the poor and clanless dwell

### Recent History (Last Century)
- **100 years ago**: The Sealing—deepest mines permanently closed after "incident"
- **75 years ago**: Last undisputed High King dies, Crown passes peacefully
- **50 years ago**: Foreign Quarter opened to boost failing trade
- **20 years ago**: High King Thorek dies in "accidental" tunnel collapse
- **6 months ago**: Hammer Crown vanishes from the Royal Vault
- **3 months ago**: Forges begin producing brittle steel, clan blame begins

### The Five Great Clans
1. **Ironfoot** (Red banners, hammer sigil): Military tradition, controls the army. "Strength is sovereignty."
2. **Goldbeard** (Gold banners, coin sigil): Wealth and trade, owns the markets. "Gold flows like water."
3. **Stonehand** (Grey banners, tower sigil): Ancient builders, maintain infrastructure. "The stone remembers."
4. **Fireforge** (Orange banners, anvil sigil): Master smiths, run the great forges. "From fire, perfection."
5. **Deepguard** (Black banners, key sigil): Mystics and lorekeepers, guard sealed tunnels. "Some doors must not open."

### The Power Brokers
- **The Merchant Consortium**: Thora Brightstone leads the only neutral organization. They hired you.
- **The Craft Guilds**: Technically neutral but members have clan loyalties
- **The Undertown Syndicates**: Crime families that profit from chaos
- **The Temple of the Forge-Father**: Tries to maintain peace, increasingly ignored

### Current Crisis
Without the Hammer Crown, no clan can prove legitimate rule. Each has ancient 
claims:
- Ironfoot: "Might makes right, we have the army"
- Goldbeard: "We feed the city, we should lead it"
- Stonehand: "We built it, we know its bones"
- Fireforge: "The forges choose the worthy"
- Deepguard: "The Crown will return to the wise"

The failing forges turned simmering tensions into near-war. The Consortium 
maintains fragile neutrality, but their hiring of outsiders (you) shows 
desperation.

## What No One Knows (Yet)
- Where is the Hammer Crown?
- Why are the forges failing—sabotage or something worse?
- What really happened in the sealed deeps 100 years ago?
- Which clan (if any) orchestrated the King's death?
- Why hire outsiders for a simple forge diagnostic?

<p>Connect character options directly to your world while maintaining player agency.</p>
<h4 id="tutorial-example-character-guidelines"><a class="header" href="#tutorial-example-character-guidelines">Tutorial Example: Character Guidelines</a></h4>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># Creating Your Character

## Core Concept
You are an outsider with skills Ironhold desperately needs. The Merchants' 
Consortium hired you because you have no clan loyalties—you can go places 
and ask questions that locals cannot.

## Ancestry Options
**Common in Ironhold**:
- **Humans**: Traders, scholars, mercenaries from surface kingdoms
- **Halflings**: Merchants, spies, entertainers from the Foreign Quarter
- **Dwarves**: Must be clanless (exile, orphan, or foreigner)

**Uncommon but Accepted**:
- **Elves/Half-elves**: Scholars, mages, diplomats (viewed with suspicion)
- **Gnomes**: Inventors, alchemists, jewelers (useful oddities)

**Rare (Needs Strong Concept)**:
- Other ancestries exist but need explanation for why Ironhold tolerates you

## Class Considerations
**Highly Valued**: 
- Investigators (Rogues, Rangers, Monks)
- Problem-solvers (Wizards, Artificers) 
- Negotiators (Bards, Clerics of trade/knowledge)

**Viewed with Suspicion**:
- Divine casters of non-dwarven gods
- Warlocks (what's your patron's interest?)
- Druids (stone over nature here)

## Starting Bonds
Every character needs:
1. **Why you're in Ironhold**: Trade? Study? Refuge? Opportunity?
2. **What you offer**: Skill that clans lack or won't trust each other with
3. **What you want**: Beyond gold—what drives you?

## Party Connections
During Session Zero, we'll establish deeper connections between PCs. The Starting 
Scenario mentioned recent events—now we'll explore how those created relationships:

- **Professional**: "We're both in the information business. Competitors or occasional partners?"
- **Circumstantial**: "We were both at [event]. Did we work together or just notice each other's competence?"
- **Reputational**: "I've heard of you. What did I hear, and is it true?"
- **Transactional**: "You did a job for me / I owe you a favor / We both got burned by the same employer"

We'll create 2-3 connections per character during Session Zero.

<h2 id="common-pitfalls"><a class="header" href="#common-pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</a></h2>
<h3 id="i-need-to-detail-everything"><a class="header" href="#i-need-to-detail-everything">“I need to detail everything”</a></h3>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Players only need enough to make characters. Save deep lore for play.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: “I’ve written 47 pages about the economic system of my world, including currency exchange rates between kingdoms.” Cool. Your players need to know: “Gold is gold, most people barter, and the Merchant Consortium controls trade.” Save those exchange rates for when the party inexplicably decides to become fantasy forex traders (which, knowing players, could actually happen).</p>
<h3 id="my-world-is-too-complex"><a class="header" href="#my-world-is-too-complex">“My world is too complex”</a></h3>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Focus on where characters start. Expand outward as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: “Players need to understand the Seventeen Years’ War of Succession, the Five Heresies of Saint Balthazar, and the complete genealogy of three royal houses.” No, they need to know: “There’s a city. It has problems. You can help for money.” When the bard inevitably tries to seduce someone important, THEN you can drop that they’re the third cousin of the deposed prince. Until then, it’s just cognitive overload.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-players-want-something-i-havent-thought-of"><a class="header" href="#what-if-players-want-something-i-havent-thought-of">“What if players want something I haven’t thought of?”</a></h3>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Say “Yes, and…” or “Yes, but…” Never just “No.”</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Player: “I want to be a ninja in your medieval European setting!”
You (internally): “But I don’t have ninjas!”
You (externally): “Interesting! Tell me more about this shadow warrior from the Far East who’s traveled to our kingdom. What brought them here?”
Boom. Now you have ninjas, they’re rare and exotic, and the player just gave you a plot hook about mysterious Eastern kingdoms. You’re welcome.</p>
