<p>Transform your initial idea into an actionable module concept. This phase typically takes 2-3 hours and creates the blueprint for everything that follows.</p>

<h4>Essential Elements to Define:</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Central Conflict</strong>
    <p>What's the main problem, mystery, or challenge? This should connect to your campaign themes and be something players can meaningfully impact. Make it personal to at least one character.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Stakes and Consequences</strong>
    <p>What happens if players succeed? What if they fail? What if they don't engage at all? All three outcomes should be interesting and move the campaign forward.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The Hook</strong>
    <p>How do players learn about this situation? Why must they act now rather than later? The best hooks combine external pressure with personal investment.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Module Scope</strong>
    <p>First module after Session Zero: 2 sessions (testing ground for player preferences)<br>
    Standard modules: 3-4 sessions (most sustainable pace)<br>
    Major arc modules: 5-6 sessions (campaign turning points)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="integration-note">Your first module is special: Keep it to 2 sessions with varied content types and explicit decision points to discover what your specific group enjoys. This investment in observation pays off in all future modules.</p>"#

<p>Fill your module skeleton with engaging content. This phase takes 3-4 hours and transforms your outline into playable material.</p>

<h4>The Five-Room Dungeon Structure</h4>
<p>This is a pacing framework, not literal rooms. Every module type benefits from these dramatic beats:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Entrance/Guardian</strong>: Initial challenge that establishes tone</li>
  <li><strong>Puzzle/Roleplay</strong>: Non-combat challenge requiring thought</li>
  <li><strong>Setback/Twist</strong>: Complication that changes the situation</li>
  <li><strong>Climax/Boss</strong>: Major confrontation or decision point</li>
  <li><strong>Revelation/Reward</strong>: Payoff and hooks for future modules</li>
</ol>

<h4>NPC Creation Priority Order:</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Quest Giver</strong>: Who presents the module's central problem?</li>
  <li><strong>Primary Antagonist</strong>: Who actively opposes the players?</li>
  <li><strong>Key Informant</strong>: Who provides crucial information?</li>
  <li><strong>Wild Card</strong>: Who complicates matters unexpectedly?</li>
  <li><strong>Supporting Cast</strong>: 2-3 minor but memorable NPCs</li>
</ol>

<h4>Encounter Design Balance:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>40% Combat</strong>: Varied difficulty and enemy types</li>
  <li><strong>30% Social</strong>: Negotiations, investigations, persuasion</li>
  <li><strong>20% Exploration</strong>: Discovery, problem-solving, navigation</li>
  <li><strong>10% Unique</strong>: Something specific to this module's theme</li>
</ul>

<h4>Information Architecture:</h4>
<p>Every essential clue needs multiple sources. Players will miss things, NPCs will die unexpectedly, and locations might be skipped. Build redundancy into your information flow. Include 1-2 red herrings maximum, and they should be interesting dead ends, not frustrating wastes of time.</p>"#

<p>Your module is complete. Now ensure it can survive contact with players. This final review takes 1-2 hours and prevents common failure points.</p>

<h4>The Three-Path Test</h4>
<p>Verify players can complete your module through different approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Combat Path</strong>: Can they fight through every obstacle?</li>
  <li><strong>Social Path</strong>: Can they negotiate and investigate their way through?</li>
  <li><strong>Stealth Path</strong>: Can they avoid direct confrontation entirely?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every encounter needs all three options, but the module as a whole should support different play styles.</p>

<h4>Failure State Planning</h4>
<p>What happens when things go wrong? Consider these scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Players miss crucial information despite redundancy</li>
  <li>Key NPCs die before revealing important details</li>
  <li>Players completely skip major locations</li>
  <li>Time pressure expires before objectives are met</li>
</ul>
<p>Each failure should lead somewhere interesting, not to a dead stop.</p>

<h4>Session Breakdown Check</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Session 1</strong>: Hook established, initial challenges faced, clear objectives</li>
  <li><strong>Middle Sessions</strong>: Investigation, development, rising complications</li>
  <li><strong>Penultimate Session</strong>: Point of no return, final preparations</li>
  <li><strong>Final Session</strong>: Climax, resolution, future seeds planted</li>
</ul>

<h4>Quick Session Prep Timeline</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>T+0</strong>: Capture raw notes immediately (20 min)</li>
  <li><strong>T-6 days</strong>: Sort into Must/Nice/Skip prep tasks (30 min)</li>
  <li><strong>T-4 days</strong>: Core prep work - see checklist below (60-90 min)</li>
  <li><strong>T-3 days</strong>: Create one-page reference (30 min)</li>
</ul>

<h4>The 8-Step Prep Checklist</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Review character status and who needs spotlight</li>
  <li>Create strong opening scene with immediate hook</li>
  <li>Outline 3-5 potential scenes with timing</li>
  <li>Ensure critical info has multiple discovery paths</li>
  <li>Prep key locations with interactive elements</li>
  <li>Define NPC appearances, voices, and wants</li>
  <li>Select encounters with tactics in mind</li>
  <li>Plan rewards that advance character arcs</li>
</ol>

<h4>Session Endings That Work</h4>
<p><strong>Cliffhanger</strong> (door opens) • <strong>Revelation</strong> (everything changes) • <strong>Decision</strong> (what do you do?) • <strong>Victory Cost</strong> (but at what price?)</p>

<p>This module's story has concluded. The sessions have been played, the challenges overcome (or not), and the consequences are now part of your campaign's history.</p>

<h4>Capture Key Outcomes</h4>
<p>Document these elements while they're fresh:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Major Decisions</strong>: What choices did players make at crucial moments?</li>
  <li><strong>Surviving NPCs</strong>: Who lived, who died, and how did relationships change?</li>
  <li><strong>Unresolved Threads</strong>: What questions remain unanswered?</li>
  <li><strong>Player Reactions</strong>: What moments generated the strongest responses?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Module Post-Mortem Questions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Did the module achieve its narrative purpose in the campaign?</li>
  <li>Which prepared content saw use, and what was bypassed entirely?</li>
  <li>How accurate was your session count estimate?</li>
  <li>What would you do differently if running this module again?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Mining for Future Content</h4>
<p>Every completed module provides material for future adventures:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consequences</strong>: How do this module's outcomes affect the world?</li>
  <li><strong>Callbacks</strong>: Which NPCs or locations could return meaningfully?</li>
  <li><strong>Themes</strong>: What themes resonated that you could explore deeper?</li>
  <li><strong>Preferences</strong>: What did you learn about your players' interests?</li>
