# Character Creation Integration Initiative

## Context

This initiative completes the campaign-to-player workflow by integrating character creation capabilities with our existing D&D rules data backend. The character creation system bridges the gap between campaign preparation and player onboarding, providing DMs with tools to guide players through character creation while maintaining integration with campaign materials and workflow management.

Building on our established Tauri foundation, Three-Board System workflow, and document management capabilities, this initiative leverages our existing SQLite database containing comprehensive D&D 5e rules data. The character creation workflow integrates seamlessly with campaign management, allowing DMs to provide players with curated options based on campaign setting and theme.

This represents the final major component of our MVP, completing the full campaign lifecycle from creation through session management to player integration.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Implement guided character creation wizard using existing D&D 5e rules data
- Create campaign-specific character creation profiles with DM-curated options
- Build character sheet generation and PDF export capabilities
- Integrate character creation with campaign roster management
- Provide character validation against official D&D 5e rules
- Enable character import/export for player sharing
- Connect character creation to campaign documents and background materials

**Non-Goals:**
- Advanced character sheet editing beyond initial creation (deferred to future phases)
- Multi-character management for players (focus on DM-facilitated creation)
- Combat encounter integration or initiative tracking
- Character progression and leveling automation
- Integration with external character sheet platforms (D&D Beyond, Roll20)
- Homebrew rule creation or modification tools
- Dice rolling or character sheet interactivity during play

## Detailed Design

**Architecture Overview:**
- Leverage existing D&D 5e rules data in SQLite database (races, classes, backgrounds, spells, equipment)
- Vue 3 character creation wizard with step-by-step guided workflow
- Character data storage integrated with campaign management system
- PDF generation for printable character sheets
- Campaign-specific character creation profiles and restrictions

**Key Components:**

1. **Character Creation Wizard**
   - Multi-step wizard: Race Selection → Class Selection → Background → Ability Scores → Equipment → Spells → Finalization
   - Real-time validation against D&D 5e rules and campaign restrictions  
   - Guided recommendations based on campaign setting and player preferences
   - Ability score generation methods (point buy, standard array, rolling)
   - Equipment selection based on class and background packages

2. **Campaign Character Profiles**
   - DM-configurable character creation restrictions per campaign
   - Allowed/restricted races, classes, backgrounds based on campaign setting
   - Custom starting equipment or gold options
   - Campaign-specific background variants and customizations
   - Integration with campaign documents for lore and setting information

3. **Character Sheet Generation**
   - Comprehensive character sheet with all D&D 5e standard fields
   - PDF export with official-style formatting
   - Character portrait and basic biographical information
   - Equipment, spell lists, and ability calculations
   - Campaign integration fields (party role, character connections)

4. **Campaign Roster Management**
   - Party roster view with all player characters
   - Character status tracking (active, retired, NPC)
   - Quick reference cards for DM session preparation
   - Character relationship mapping and party dynamics
   - Integration with session planning and Three-Board System

**Data Models:**
- Character: id, campaign_id, player_name, character_data (JSON), status, created/updated
- CharacterCreationProfile: id, campaign_id, restrictions, allowed_options, settings
- PartyRoster: campaign_id, character_list, party_composition, notes
- CharacterSnapshot: versioned character states for campaign progression

## Alternatives Considered

**Integration with D&D Beyond API:**
- Pros: Comprehensive official content, maintained by Wizards of the Coast
- Cons: External dependency, API limitations, requires internet connectivity, potential licensing issues
- Rejected: Conflicts with local-first architecture and creates external service dependency

**Full Character Sheet Editor (Beyond Creation):**
- Pros: Complete character management lifecycle
- Cons: Massive scope increase, complex UI/UX requirements, deferred value delivery
- Rejected: Focus on creation workflow first, editing features can be added in future phases

**Embed Existing Character Creator (iframe/webview):**
- Pros: Leverage existing tools, faster development
- Cons: Poor integration with campaign data, inconsistent UX, limited customization
- Rejected: Breaks seamless workflow integration with campaign management

**Simple Form-Based Creation (No Wizard):**
- Pros: Simpler implementation, familiar interface pattern
- Cons: Overwhelming for new players, poor validation feedback, reduced user guidance
- Rejected: Guided wizard approach better serves target user experience

**Mobile-First Character Creation:**
- Pros: Modern UX pattern, accessible for players
- Cons: Desktop application architecture mismatch, complex responsive design
- Rejected: Desktop application focus maintains consistency with overall platform approach

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Character Data Foundation (Week 1-2)**
- Extend SQLite schema with character and roster tables
- Create character data models and validation logic in Rust backend
- Implement character CRUD operations via Tauri commands
- Build basic character storage and retrieval functionality
- Create character data JSON schema for standardized storage

**Phase 2: Character Creation Wizard (Week 2-3)**
- Design and implement multi-step wizard UI components
- Create race selection step with trait and ability score preview
- Build class selection with feature and proficiency display
- Implement background selection with skill and equipment options
- Add ability score generation with multiple methods (point buy, standard array, dice rolling)

**Phase 3: Equipment & Spell Selection (Week 3-4)**
- Implement equipment selection based on class and background packages
- Create spell selection interface for spellcasting classes
- Build equipment calculation and carrying capacity validation
- Add starting gold and custom equipment purchase options
- Integrate equipment data from existing D&D 5e database

**Phase 4: Campaign Integration (Week 4-5)**  
- Create campaign character creation profiles with DM restrictions
- Implement allowed/restricted content filtering per campaign
- Build campaign roster management interface
- Add character-to-campaign assignment and status tracking
- Integrate character creation with campaign documents and lore

**Phase 5: Character Sheet Generation (Week 5-6)**
- Design character sheet layout and PDF generation
- Implement comprehensive character sheet with all D&D 5e fields
- Create character export/import functionality

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing:**
- Character data validation against D&D 5e rules
- Ability score calculation and modifier generation
- Equipment selection and carrying capacity calculations  
- Spell selection validation for spellcasting classes
- Character JSON serialization and deserialization

**Integration Testing:**
- Complete character creation workflow from start to finish
- Campaign restriction enforcement during character creation
