# Implement Creature Data Processor

## Description

Implement the DataProcessor for bestiary JSON files, focusing on creatures with CR 0-10 for the MVP.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Parse creature JSON structure
- [ ] Filter creatures by CR (0-10 only)
- [ ] Transform ability scores
- [ ] Process actions and traits
- [ ] Handle legendary actions
- [ ] Parse AC and HP formulas
- [ ] Process speed types
- [ ] Generate consistent creature IDs

## Technical Notes

Complex parsing required for:
- Multiple AC types (natural, armor, etc.)
- Speed objects (walk, fly, swim, etc.)
- Action economy (actions, bonus, reactions)
- Trait and action formatting
- Damage immunities/resistances/vulnerabilities

## Dependencies
