# Document & Template Management Initiative

## Context

This initiative builds upon the Tauri foundation and Three-Board System to provide comprehensive document and template management capabilities. Campaign management requires organizing vast amounts of content - NPCs, locations, plot hooks, session notes, handouts, and more. Without proper organization tools, DMs struggle to maintain consistency and quickly access relevant materials during sessions.

The document management system integrates directly with the Three-Board workflow, allowing DMs to attach relevant documents to board items and maintain organized campaign libraries. Templates provide reusable starting points for common campaign elements, accelerating content creation while maintaining quality and consistency.

This initiative transforms Mimir from a workflow management tool into a comprehensive campaign content management platform, addressing one of the most time-consuming aspects of campaign preparation.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Implement comprehensive document organization system for campaign materials
- Create template library with pre-built campaign elements (NPCs, locations, adventures)
- Build document editor with structured content creation tools
- Enable document linking and cross-referencing between campaign materials
- Provide document search and filtering capabilities
- Support document versioning and revision history
- Integrate document management with Three-Board System workflow

**Non-Goals:**
- Real-time collaborative editing (multiplayer features out of scope)
- Advanced rich text formatting (focus on structured content over visual design)
- External file format import/export beyond basic text formats
- AI-powered content generation (deferred to future phases)
- Complex document workflow approval processes
- Cloud storage or sync capabilities

## Detailed Design

**Architecture Overview:**
- Document storage using SQLite with full-text search capabilities
- Vue 3 components for document creation, editing, and organization
- Template system with parameterized content generation
- File-based document storage with database metadata indexing
- Integration with Three-Board System for document-to-workflow linking

**Key Components:**

1. **Document Management System**
   - Hierarchical folder structure for campaign organization
   - Document types: NPCs, Locations, Adventures, Session Notes, Handouts, Rules References
   - Tagging system for cross-cutting categorization
   - Full-text search across all document content
   - Document linking and cross-reference capabilities

2. **Template Library**
   - Pre-built templates for common campaign elements
   - Parameterized template system for content generation
   - Template categories: NPCs, Locations, Adventures, Encounters, Organizations
   - Custom template creation and sharing capabilities
   - Template versioning and update management

3. **Document Editor**
   - Structured content editor with form-based input for consistency
   - Rich text editing for narrative sections
   - Metadata fields specific to document types
   - Image and asset attachment capabilities
   - Draft/published status workflow

4. **Three-Board Integration**
   - Attach documents to board items (NPCs to encounters, locations to adventures)
   - Auto-suggest relevant documents based on board item context
   - Quick access to associated documents from board views
   - Document status tracking within workflow context

**Data Models:**
- Document: id, title, type, content, metadata, tags, created/updated timestamps
- Template: id, name, category, parameters, content structure, usage count
- DocumentAttachment: links documents to board items with relationship metadata
- DocumentVersion: revision history and change tracking

## Alternatives Considered

**External Document Management (Google Docs, Notion, Obsidian integration):**
- Pros: Leverages existing tools, no need to build editor
- Cons: Breaks local-first architecture, complex API integrations, user workflow fragmentation
- Rejected: Conflicts with local-first principle and creates external dependencies

**File System Based Only (No Database):**
- Pros: Simple implementation, familiar file organization
- Cons: No metadata indexing, poor search capabilities, difficult cross-referencing
- Rejected: Insufficient for complex campaign organization needs

**Full Rich Text Editor (WYSIWYG approach):**
- Pros: Familiar editing experience, flexible formatting
- Cons: Complex implementation, inconsistent structured data, poor mobile/accessibility
- Rejected: Structured content more important than visual formatting for campaign management

**Markdown-Only Editor:**
- Pros: Simple implementation, text-based, version control friendly
- Cons: Limited structure enforcement, poor non-technical user experience
- Rejected: Too technical for broad DM adoption

**Template System with Code/Scripting:**
- Pros: Maximum flexibility, powerful content generation
- Cons: Complex for casual users, security concerns, development overhead
- Rejected: Parameter-based templates provide sufficient flexibility with better usability

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Document Storage Foundation (Week 1-2)**
- Extend SQLite schema with document tables and full-text search indexes
- Implement document CRUD operations in Rust backend
- Create Tauri commands for document management
- Build basic document list and folder navigation UI
- Implement document search functionality

**Phase 2: Document Editor & Types (Week 2-3)**
- Create structured document editor with type-specific forms
- Implement document types: NPCs, Locations, Adventures, Session Notes
- Add rich text editing capabilities for narrative sections
- Build document metadata management (tags, categories, timestamps)
- Create document preview and view modes

**Phase 3: Template System (Week 3-4)**
- Design template data model and storage system
- Implement template creation and parameterization UI
- Build template library with pre-built campaign templates
- Create template instantiation workflow
- Add template search and categorization

**Phase 4: Three-Board Integration (Week 4-5)**
- Implement document attachment system for board items
- Create document suggestion engine based on board context
- Build quick access panels for associated documents
- Add document status tracking within workflow
- Integrate document search with board item creation

**Phase 5: Polish & Advanced Features (Week 5-6)**
- Implement document versioning and revision history
- Add document export capabilities (PDF, HTML, plain text)
- Create document sharing and reference tools
- Performance optimization for large document collections
- User testing and workflow refinement

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing:**
- Document CRUD operations with validation and error handling
- Template parameterization and instantiation logic
- Full-text search functionality and performance
- Document-to-board-item attachment relationships
- File storage and metadata consistency

**Integration Testing:**
- Frontend-backend document management workflows
- Template creation and usage end-to-end testing
- Document search across different content types and sizes
- Three-Board System integration with document attachments
- Document export functionality across formats

**User Acceptance Testing:**
- Document creation workflow for different campaign element types
- Template usage for rapid content creation
- Document organization and search in realistic campaign scenarios
- Integration with existing campaign workflows from Initiative 2
- Document management performance with large campaign libraries

**Performance Testing:**
- Full-text search response times with large document collections
- Document editor responsiveness with large content
- Template instantiation performance with complex parameters
- Database query optimization for document metadata operations

**Success Criteria:**
- Create and organize 50+ documents across multiple types without performance degradation
- Template instantiation completes in under 5 seconds for complex templates
- Full-text search returns results in under 200ms for document collections up to 1000 items
- Document-to-board integration workflows complete without requiring context switching
- 90%+ user task completion rate for document management workflows
- Template library reduces campaign prep time by 30%+ compared to manual creation
