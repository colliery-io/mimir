# Tauri Foundation & Campaign Management Core Initiative

## Context

This initiative establishes the foundational desktop application architecture using Tauri + Vue 3 + TypeScript and implements core campaign management functionality. It represents our pivot from a terminal-based application to a modern GUI platform that will provide better usability and broader adoption potential.

The initiative builds on our existing Rust backend (SQLite database and D&D rules data) while creating a new frontend that can effectively serve DMs' campaign management needs. Success here enables all subsequent initiatives by providing the technical foundation and integration patterns.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Set up cross-platform Tauri desktop application with Vue 3 + TypeScript frontend
- Establish communication patterns between frontend and existing Rust backend
- Implement basic campaign CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Create foundational UI components and navigation structure
- Demonstrate working desktop application that launches on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Establish build and packaging pipeline for distribution

**Non-Goals:**
- Advanced workflow management features (covered in Initiative 2)
- Document management system (covered in Initiative 3)
- Character creation integration (covered in Initiative 4)
- Complex UI/UX design - focus on functional foundation
- Performance optimization beyond basic responsiveness

## Detailed Design

**Architecture Overview:**
- Tauri application shell with Vue 3 + TypeScript frontend
- Existing Rust backend crates (mimir-dm-core, mimir-dm-db) exposed via Tauri commands
- SQLite database maintains existing schema and data
- Frontend communicates with backend through Tauri's IPC mechanism

**Key Components:**
1. **Tauri Configuration**: Set up cross-platform builds, window management, and security policies
2. **Vue 3 Application**: Component-based architecture with TypeScript for type safety
3. **Backend Integration**: Tauri commands that wrap existing Rust functionality
4. **Campaign Data Models**: TypeScript interfaces matching Rust backend models
5. **Basic UI Framework**: Navigation, layout components, and fundamental styling

**Campaign Management Features:**
- Campaign list view with search and filtering
- Campaign creation wizard with basic metadata fields
- Campaign detail view with editing capabilities
- Settings and preferences management
- Data validation and error handling

## Alternatives Considered

**Web Application (React/Vue SPA):**
- Pros: Familiar tech stack, easier deployment
- Cons: No local file system access, requires server infrastructure, online dependency
- Rejected: Conflicts with local-first architecture principle

**Electron + React/Vue:**
- Pros: Mature ecosystem, extensive documentation
- Cons: Large bundle size, higher memory usage, security concerns
- Rejected: Tauri provides better performance and security with Rust backend integration

**Native Desktop (Qt, GTK, or platform-specific):**
- Pros: Maximum performance and native integration
- Cons: Platform-specific development, limited web tech reuse, complex build pipeline
- Rejected: Development overhead too high for MVP timeline

**Continue with TUI (Ratatui):**
- Pros: Leverages existing Rust expertise, fast development
- Cons: Limited user adoption potential, complex workflows hard to navigate
- Rejected: User feedback indicated GUI necessary for broader adoption

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1-2)**
- Initialize Tauri project with Vue 3 + TypeScript template
- Configure cross-platform builds and development environment
- Set up basic project structure and build pipeline
- Create initial application shell with basic navigation

**Phase 2: Backend Integration (Week 2-3)**  
- Expose existing Rust backend functionality via Tauri commands
- Implement data models and type definitions in TypeScript
- Create database connection and basic query operations
- Test backend communication patterns

**Phase 3: Campaign Management UI (Week 3-4)**
- Build campaign list view with basic CRUD operations
- Implement campaign creation wizard with form validation
- Create campaign detail view with editing capabilities
- Add basic error handling and user feedback

**Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Week 4-5)**
- Cross-platform testing and bug fixes
- Performance optimization for UI responsiveness  
- Package application for distribution
- User acceptance testing with basic workflows

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing:**
- Frontend component testing with Vue Test Utils and Vitest
- Backend Tauri command testing with existing Rust test framework
- Data model validation and type safety verification

**Integration Testing:**
- Frontend-backend communication via Tauri IPC
- Database operations through application interface
- Cross-platform build and packaging verification

**User Acceptance Testing:**
- Campaign creation and management workflows
- Application startup and basic navigation
- Data persistence and retrieval
- Cross-platform functionality validation

**Success Criteria:**
- Application launches successfully on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Users can create, view, edit, and delete campaigns without errors
- Backend integration maintains data consistency
- Build pipeline produces distributable packages
- Core workflows complete in under 30 seconds
