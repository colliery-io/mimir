# MVP Development Strategy Strategy

## Problem Statement

Building a comprehensive D&D assistant requires tackling multiple complex technical challenges: data ingestion, semantic search, intelligent NPC generation, and real-time session management. Without a clear phased approach, we risk building features that don't integrate well or creating a system that's too complex to maintain.

The MVP strategy focuses on building a solid foundation first, then layering intelligence on top. Each phase delivers standalone value while preparing for the next, ensuring we maintain momentum and can validate our approach with real DMs early and often.

## Success Metrics

- Working prototype with core D&D data queryable in < 100ms
- Functional character creation following all RAW rules  
- Basic campaign management with NPC tracking
- Semantic search returning relevant results 95%+ of the time
- Initial user testing shows 80%+ task completion rate
- Architecture supports future LLM integration without major refactoring

## Solution Approach

Build Mimir in three foundational phases that each deliver immediate value:

**Phase 0: Data Foundation** - Ingest and structure all D&D 5e rules data into a fast, queryable SQLite database. This gives us a clean data layer that all future features can build upon.

**Phase 0.5: Core Workflows** - Implement deterministic character creation and DM management tools based on RAW rules. This validates our data model and provides immediate utility without requiring AI.

**Phase 1: Semantic Layer** - Add intelligent search via FTS5, vector embeddings, and local LLM integration. This transforms our structured data into a knowledge base that understands context and intent.

Each phase is independently valuable, reduces technical risk, and prepares the foundation for the next. We'll validate with real DMs after each phase to ensure we're building the right thing.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- Core D&D 5e rules data (SRD content)
- Character creation with RAW validation
- Basic campaign and NPC management
- Semantic search for rules and content
- Local-first architecture with SQLite
- TUI interface for all features
- Integration with local LLMs (Ollama)

**Out of Scope:**
- Multiplayer/shared campaigns
- Cloud sync or online features
- Non-5e game systems
- Combat automation
- Virtual tabletop features
- Mobile or web interfaces
- Homebrew content creation tools
- AI-generated artwork or maps

## Risks & Unknowns

- **Data Quality**: 5etools data structure complexity may require significant transformation effort
- **Performance**: Vector search at scale might not meet sub-second requirements on older hardware
- **LLM Reliability**: Local models may not be sophisticated enough for complex rule interactions
- **User Adoption**: DMs may resist terminal interfaces despite efficiency benefits
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensuring we only use truly open content while providing comprehensive coverage
- **Scope Creep**: Pressure to add VTT features or online capabilities

## Implementation Dependencies

**Critical Path:**
1. Phase 0 (Data Foundation) - No dependencies, must complete first
2. Phase 0.5 (Core Workflows) - Depends on Phase 0 data model
3. Phase 1 (Semantic Layer) - Depends on Phase 0 data and can run parallel to some Phase 0.5 work

**Technical Dependencies:**
- SQLite for all data storage
- Rust ecosystem (tokio, serde, sqlx)
- 5etools data files as source
- Ollama for LLM integration (Phase 1)
- Ratatui for TUI framework

**Initiative Flow:**
- Each phase produces working software
- User testing between phases informs next iteration
- Architecture decisions in Phase 0 impact all future work
- Data model must be extensible for future phases

## Change Log

###  Initial Strategy
- **Change**: Created initial MVP development strategy with three-phase approach
- **Rationale**: Need structured approach to build complex D&D assistant without overwhelming scope
- **Impact**: Clear roadmap for building foundation → workflows → intelligence in manageable phases
