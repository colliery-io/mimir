# Enhanced Capabilities Initiative

## Context

This initiative covers Phase 3 of the implementation plan (Weeks 5-6), adding Plot Thread Manager and Session Orchestrator agents, and developing the comprehensive TUI interface using Ratatui. This phase transforms the backend capabilities into a usable application that DMs can interact with during campaign management and live sessions.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Implement Plot Thread Manager agent for story arc tracking and connection suggestions
- Create Session Orchestrator agent for preparation and execution support  
- Build comprehensive TUI interface with Ratatui including main campaign view, NPC management, and plot tracking
- Integrate all agents into cohesive user experience with mode switching (F1-F5 keys)
- Implement quick search overlay and command palette functionality
- Create campaign management and switching capabilities

**Non-Goals:**
- Advanced AI features or consistency checking
- Complex data visualization beyond basic progress tracking
- Export/import functionality
- Multi-campaign simultaneous management

## Detailed Design

**Plot Thread Manager Agent:**
- Plot status tracking with progress indicators (0-100%)
- Connection detection between plots, NPCs, and locations
- Automatic suggestion of next steps and story developments
- Visual thread representation with relationship mapping

**Session Orchestrator Agent:**
- Pre-session preparation with checklist generation
- Session outline creation based on active plots and NPCs
- Post-session summary generation and continuity updates
- Encounter and scene preparation tools

**TUI Interface Architecture (Ratatui):**
```
Main Views:
- Campaign Dashboard (default) - Query interface + context panel
- NPC Management (F2) - List/detail view with search and relationships
- Plot Thread Tracker (F3) - Visual plot status and connections
- Session Planner (F4) - Preparation tools and session management
- Quick Search Overlay (F5) - Global search across all content
```

**Navigation System:**
- Global shortcuts (F1-F5) for mode switching
- Tab cycling between panels within modes
- Context-sensitive help system
- Command palette (Ctrl+/) for advanced operations

**Data Integration:**
- Real-time synchronization between agents and UI
- Event-driven updates when campaign data changes
- Consistent state management across all interface modes

## Alternatives Considered

**UI Framework Alternatives:**
- Egui: Rejected due to complexity and immediate mode overhead
- Iced: Rejected due to limited terminal support and GPU requirements
- Cursive: Rejected due to less active development and limited layout options
- Ratatui: Selected for mature TUI capabilities and excellent Rust integration

**Plot Tracking Approaches:**
- Linear timeline view: Rejected due to poor representation of interconnected plots
- Graph visualization: Considered but too complex for terminal interface
- Hierarchical tree: Rejected due to inability to show cross-connections
- Status-based list with connection sidebar: Selected for optimal information density

**Session Management Models:**
- Calendar integration: Rejected due to external dependency requirements
- Simple note-taking: Rejected as insufficient for preparation needs
- Structured preparation workflow: Selected for comprehensive DM support

## Implementation Plan

**Week 5:**
- Day 1-2: Implement Plot Thread Manager agent with connection detection
- Day 3-4: Create Session Orchestrator agent with preparation workflows
- Day 5-7: Build basic Ratatui application structure with main dashboard view

**Week 6:**
- Day 1-3: Implement NPC Management interface (F2) with search and relationships
- Day 4-5: Create Plot Thread Tracker interface (F3) with visual status display
- Day 6-7: Add Session Planner interface (F4) and Quick Search overlay (F5)

**Deliverables:**
- Two additional functional agents (Plot Thread Manager, Session Orchestrator)
- Complete TUI interface with all five major modes
- Integrated user experience with seamless mode switching
- Campaign management capabilities (create, load, switch campaigns)

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Plot connection detection algorithms and accuracy
- Session preparation workflow logic and checklist generation
- TUI component rendering and user input handling
- Navigation between interface modes and panels

**Integration Tests:**
- End-to-end plot tracking with real campaign scenarios
- Session orchestration from preparation through execution
- UI state consistency across mode switches and data updates
- Campaign switching and data isolation

**Usability Tests:**
- Interface responsiveness and intuitiveness for DM workflows
- Keyboard navigation efficiency and discoverability
- Information display clarity and readability in terminal environment

**Validation Criteria:**
- All five interface modes fully functional with smooth transitions
- Plot connections accurately detected and displayed
- Session preparation reduces DM prep time demonstrably
- Interface remains responsive with large campaign datasets (100+ NPCs)
