# initial implementation Strategy

## Problem Statement

Building a complete, production-ready D&D campaign assistant from scratch is an ambitious undertaking that requires careful prioritization and phased implementation. The challenge is to deliver a functional, valuable tool within the 8-week timeline while establishing a solid foundation for future enhancements.

The initial implementation must balance several competing priorities:
- Demonstrating core value proposition quickly to validate the concept
- Building robust technical foundations that won't require complete rewrites
- Implementing enough features to be genuinely useful for DMs
- Maintaining code quality and architectural integrity under time pressure
- Creating a user experience that feels polished despite limited development time

## Success Metrics

- **Functional Milestone**: Working TUI application with basic NPC management, rule lookup, and session notes
- **Performance Target**: All queries respond within 5 seconds on standard consumer hardware
- **Feature Coverage**: Core workflow complete from campaign creation through session execution
- **Technical Quality**: Stable architecture supporting future enhancements without major rewrites
- **User Validation**: Positive feedback from initial DM testing on core value proposition
- **Code Quality**: Comprehensive test coverage for core functionality and clean, documented codebase

## Solution Approach

**Four-Phase Development Strategy:**

**Phase 1 - Foundation (Weeks 1-2):**
Build core technical infrastructure including SQLite database with vector extensions, Ollama integration for local AI, and initial rule data import with dual indexing (FTS5 + embeddings).

**Phase 2 - Core Agents (Weeks 3-4):**
Implement agent framework with message passing, develop NPC Manager as the primary agent, and create RAG pipeline for intelligent information retrieval.

**Phase 3 - Enhanced Capabilities (Weeks 5-6):**
Add Plot Thread Manager and Session Orchestrator agents, develop comprehensive TUI interface with Ratatui, and integrate all components into cohesive user experience.

**Phase 4 - Intelligence Layer (Weeks 7-8):**
Implement smart features like consistency checking and narrative suggestions, optimize performance to meet response time targets, and polish user experience.

**Technical Architecture:**
Lightweight actor pattern for agent communication, hybrid search combining FTS5 and vector similarity, local-first data processing with SQLite as the single source of truth.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- SQLite database with vector search and FTS5 capabilities
- Ollama integration for local AI processing (llama3/mistral models)
- Basic TUI interface using Ratatui framework
- NPC Manager agent with personality and relationship tracking
- Plot Thread Manager for story arc management
- Session Orchestrator for preparation and execution support
- Rule Advisor for SRD content lookup
- Hybrid search system combining exact matches and semantic similarity
- Core campaign data models (NPCs, plots, sessions, rules)
- 5e-bits rule data integration
- Basic consistency checking functionality
- Performance optimization for <2s response times

**Out of Scope:**
- Advanced GUI interface or web frontend
- Multi-user or networked functionality
- Cloud-based AI models or external APIs
- Complex visualization and charting features
- Character sheet management or player-facing tools
- Combat automation or dice rolling mechanics
- Rule systems beyond D&D 5e
- Mobile applications or cross-platform deployment
- Advanced analytics or campaign statistics
- Audio/visual content processing
- Plugin system or third-party integrations

## Risks & Unknowns

- **SQLite Vector Extension Complexity**: sqlite-vss integration may be more complex than anticipated, potentially impacting hybrid search implementation timeline
- **Ollama Performance Variability**: Local AI model performance on consumer hardware is unpredictable and may not meet <5s response time requirements
- **Ratatui Learning Curve**: TUI framework complexity could slow UI development, especially for complex layouts like plot visualization
- **Agent Framework Over-Engineering**: Message-passing architecture might introduce unnecessary complexity for initial single-user application
- **Rule Data Processing**: 5e-bits JSON parsing and indexing may require more preprocessing than expected
- **Search Relevance Tuning**: Hybrid search weight optimization (FTS5 vs vector similarity) may require extensive experimentation
- **Memory Usage**: Vector embeddings for large campaigns could exceed 4GB RAM constraint on consumer hardware
- **Development Velocity**: Single developer timeline assumes no major blockers or scope creep during 8-week development window

## Implementation Dependencies

**Critical Path Dependencies:**

**Phase 1 → Phase 2:**
- SQLite database with vector extensions must be functional before agent development
- Ollama integration and embedding generation required for RAG pipeline
- Rule data import and indexing blocks intelligent query functionality

**Phase 2 → Phase 3:**
- Agent framework foundation required before implementing additional agents
- NPC Manager must be stable before Plot Thread Manager can reference NPCs
- RAG pipeline essential for all intelligent agent functionality

**Phase 3 → Phase 4:**
- Basic TUI interface needed before advanced feature polish  
- All core agents must be functional before consistency checking implementation
- Performance baseline established before optimization efforts

**External Dependencies:**
- Ollama service availability and model downloads
- sqlite-vss extension compilation and installation
- 5e-bits rule data accessibility and format stability
- Ratatui framework stability and documentation quality

**Sequential Constraints:**
- Database schema design must accommodate all planned agent data models
- Search architecture decisions impact all subsequent query functionality
- TUI layout structure affects all user interface development
