# Cleanup and standardize Cargo.toml dependencies

*This template includes sections for various types of tasks. Delete sections that don't apply to your specific use case.*

## Parent Initiative **[CONDITIONAL: Assigned Task]**

[[MIMIR-I-0001]]

## Objective **[REQUIRED]**

Cleanup and standardize Cargo.toml dependencies across the workspace to improve maintainability, reduce duplication, and ensure version consistency across all crates.

### Type
- [ ] Bug - Production issue that needs fixing
- [ ] Feature - New functionality or enhancement
- [x] Tech Debt - Code improvement or refactoring
- [ ] Chore - Maintenance or setup work

### Priority
- [ ] P0 - Critical (blocks users/revenue)
- [ ] P1 - High (important for user experience)
- [x] P2 - Medium (nice to have)
- [ ] P3 - Low (when time permits)

### Technical Debt Impact

**Current Problems**:
1. **Version Inconsistencies**:
   - `tokio`: workspace has `"1.0"`, mimir-5etools-splitter has `"1.37"`
   - `reqwest`: workspace has `"0.11"`, mimir-dm has `"0.12"`
   - `uuid`: workspace has `"1.0"`, mimir-dm explicitly specifies `"1.10"`

2. **mimir-5etools-splitter not using workspace dependencies**:
   - All dependencies hardcoded instead of using `{ workspace = true }`
   - Duplicates version numbers that should be centralized

3. **Duplicated dependencies across crates**:
   - `tempfile` repeated in multiple `[dev-dependencies]`
   - `tokio-util` appears in mimir-dm and mimir-dm-llm
   - `similar` appears in mimir-dm and mimir-dm-llm
   - `regex` appears in mimir-dm-llm and mimir-5etools-splitter
   - `r2d2` hardcoded in mimir-dm despite being in workspace

4. **Commented-out code in mimir-dm**:
   - Lines 51-54 have commented-out TUI dependencies

5. **Missing workspace dependencies**:
   - Common dependencies like `tokio-util`, `similar`, `regex`, `tempfile` should be in workspace

**Benefits of Fixing**:
- Single source of truth for dependency versions
- Easier to update dependencies across all crates
- Reduced risk of version conflicts
- Cleaner crate-level Cargo.toml files
- Faster dependency resolution by Cargo

**Risk Assessment**:
- Low risk: No logic changes, only dependency management
- Versions will be updated to match workspace (potential compatibility check needed)
- All tests verify functionality remains intact

## Acceptance Criteria **[REQUIRED]**

- [ ] All version inconsistencies resolved (tokio, reqwest, uuid match workspace)
- [ ] Common dependencies moved to workspace.dependencies (tokio-util, similar, regex, tempfile, etc.)
- [ ] All crates use `{ workspace = true }` for shared dependencies
- [ ] Commented-out code removed from mimir-dm/Cargo.toml
- [ ] `cargo check` passes for all crates
- [ ] `cargo test` passes for all tests
- [ ] No duplicate dependency versions across workspace

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Approach

**Step 1: Add missing dependencies to workspace**
Add to `Cargo.toml` workspace.dependencies:
- `tokio-util = "0.7"`
- `similar = "2.6"`
- `regex = "1.10"`
- `tempfile = "3.10"`
- `walkdir = "2.5"`
- `flate2 = "1.0"`
- `tar = "0.4"`
- `base64 = "0.22.1"`

**Step 2: Update workspace versions to latest compatible**
- Update `tokio` from "1.0" to "1.37" (match mimir-5etools-splitter)
- Update `reqwest` from "0.11" to "0.12" (match mimir-dm)
- Update `uuid` from "1.0" to "1.10" (match mimir-dm)

**Step 3: Update mimir-5etools-splitter/Cargo.toml**
Replace hardcoded versions with `{ workspace = true }` for:
- anyhow, chrono, clap, flate2, rayon, serde, serde_json
- tar, tempfile, tokio, tracing, tracing-subscriber, walkdir, regex
- diesel, diesel_migrations

**Step 4: Update mimir-dm/Cargo.toml**
- Change `r2d2 = "0.8"` to `r2d2 = { workspace = true }`
- Remove explicit `uuid = { version = "1.10", ... }`; use workspace
- Change `tera = "1.19"` to `tera = { workspace = true }`
- Change `tempfile = "3.10"` to `tempfile = { workspace = true }`
- Remove commented-out dependencies (lines 51-54)

**Step 5: Update mimir-dm-llm/Cargo.toml**
- Change `serde_yaml = "0.9"` to `serde_yaml = { workspace = true }`
- Change `url = "2.5"` to `url = { workspace = true }`
- Change `similar = "2.6"` to `similar = { workspace = true }`
- Change `regex = "1.10"` to `regex = { workspace = true }`
- Change `tempfile = "3.0"` to `tempfile = { workspace = true }`

**Step 6: Update mimir-dm-core/Cargo.toml**
- Change dev-dependency `tempfile = "3.0"` to `tempfile = { workspace = true }`

**Step 7: Verify**
- Run `cargo check --workspace`
- Run `cargo test --workspace`

### Dependencies

None - this is a self-contained refactoring task.

### Risk Considerations

**Low Risk**:
- Only dependency management changes
- No code logic changes
- Version updates are minor/patch within same major versions
- Tests will catch any incompatibilities

## Status Updates **[REQUIRED]**

### Implementation Complete - 2025-10-27

Successfully cleaned up and standardized Cargo.toml dependencies across the workspace to improve maintainability and ensure version consistency.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Workspace Cargo.toml** (`Cargo.toml`):
   - Updated tokio from "1.0" to "1.37"
   - Updated reqwest from "0.11" to "0.12"
   - Updated uuid from "1.0" to "1.10"
   - Added missing common dependencies:
     - tokio-util = "0.7"
     - regex = "1.10"
     - similar = "2.6"
     - tempfile = "3.10"
     - walkdir = "2.5"
     - flate2 = "1.0"
     - tar = "0.4"
     - base64 = "0.22.1"
     - rayon = "1.10"

2. **mimir-5etools-splitter** (`crates/mimir-5etools-splitter/Cargo.toml`):
   - Migrated all dependencies to use `{ workspace = true }`
   - Updated: anyhow, chrono, clap, diesel, diesel_migrations, flate2, rayon, regex, serde, serde_json, tar, tempfile, tokio, tracing, tracing-subscriber, walkdir

3. **mimir-dm** (`crates/mimir-dm/Cargo.toml`):
   - Replaced hardcoded versions with workspace references
   - Updated: r2d2, tera, tokio-util, base64, tar, flate2, tempfile, walkdir, uuid, similar, reqwest
   - Removed commented-out TUI dependencies (lines 51-54)

4. **mimir-dm-llm** (`crates/mimir-dm-llm/Cargo.toml`):
   - Migrated to workspace dependencies: tokio-util, serde_yaml, url, similar, regex, tempfile
   - Added `autotests = false` and explicit `[[test]]` configuration to fix test organization
   - Fixed `model_management.rs` import to use `crate::common` for proper test module structure

5. **mimir-dm-core** (`crates/mimir-dm-core/Cargo.toml`):
   - Updated tempfile dev-dependency to use workspace reference

**Testing Results**:
- `cargo check --workspace`: Passed (18.25s)
- `cargo test --workspace`: Compiled successfully
  - mimir-5etools-splitter: 13 tests passed
  - mimir-dm-core: 50 service tests passed, 37/41 integration tests passed
  - Note: 4 pre-existing test failures in mimir-dm-core integration tests (unrelated to dependency changes):
    - test_invalid_campaign_transitions
    - test_list_active_campaigns
    - test_invalid_session_transitions
    - test_campaign_card_workflow

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Single source of truth for dependency versions in workspace

- Cleaner crate-level Cargo.toml files
