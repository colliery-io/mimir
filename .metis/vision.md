# mimir Vision

## Purpose

Mimir exists to solve the cognitive complexity problem that Dungeon Masters face when running D&D campaigns. As campaigns grow in complexity with multiple NPCs, interconnected plots, and rich narrative details, DMs struggle to maintain consistency and recall important information during sessions. Mimir aims to be an intelligent assistant that preserves narrative continuity, tracks relationships and motivations, and provides contextual assistance without disrupting the natural flow of storytelling.

## Current State

Currently, Dungeon Masters rely on fragmented tools and manual processes to manage campaigns. They use basic note-taking apps, physical notebooks, generic spreadsheets, and various disconnected digital tools. This creates several problems:

- Information is scattered across multiple platforms
- No intelligent connection between NPCs, plots, and session events
- Manual effort required to maintain consistency
- Difficulty recalling contextual details during live sessions
- No semantic search or AI-assisted information retrieval
- Generic tools that don't understand D&D-specific concepts and relationships

The existing D&D tools focus heavily on rules automation and character sheets rather than narrative management and DM cognitive support.

## Future State

Mimir will be a local-first, intelligent TUI application that serves as a DM's trusted companion. The future state includes:

**Intelligent Campaign Management:**
- All campaign information centralized in a single, searchable interface
- AI-powered semantic search that understands D&D concepts and relationships
- Automatic consistency checking and gentle suggestions for narrative continuity
- Context-aware information retrieval during live sessions

**Advanced NPC System:**
- NPCs with persistent personalities, motivations, and relationship tracking
- Automatic connection detection between characters and plot threads
- Voice and behavioral consistency reminders based on past interactions

**Plot Thread Intelligence:**
- Visual plot tracking with automatic connection suggestions
- Progress indicators and resolution paths
- Integration between NPCs, locations, and story arcs

**Seamless Session Support:**
- Real-time query system with natural language interface
- Pre-session preparation tools with smart recommendations
- Post-session summary generation and continuity updates

**Technical Excellence:**
- Sub-2-second response times for all queries
- Hybrid search combining exact matches with semantic understanding
- Local AI processing for privacy and reliability
- Beautiful, intuitive TUI interface optimized for DM workflow

## Success Criteria

We will know the vision is achieved when:

**User Experience Metrics:**
- DMs can find any campaign information within 2 seconds of querying
- 90% of consistency issues are caught and flagged automatically
- Session preparation time is reduced by 50% compared to traditional methods
- DMs report improved narrative continuity and player engagement

**Technical Performance:**
- All queries respond in under 2 seconds on consumer hardware
- System handles campaigns with 100+ NPCs and 50+ plot threads efficiently
- Local AI processing maintains privacy while delivering intelligent assistance
- Application starts and loads campaign data in under 500ms

**Adoption Indicators:**
- DMs choose Mimir over existing solutions for new campaigns
- Users successfully migrate existing campaigns into Mimir
- Community contributions to rules database and features
- Positive feedback on narrative consistency and session flow improvements

**Functional Completeness:**
- Full NPC lifecycle management with relationship tracking
- Complete plot thread visualization and management
- Seamless session support from preparation through execution
- Hybrid search delivering relevant results for both exact and semantic queries

## Principles

**Local-First Privacy:** All data processing occurs locally to protect campaign secrets and ensure DMs maintain complete control over their creative content.

**Narrative Over Automation:** Focus on supporting storytelling and narrative consistency rather than automating gameplay mechanics or replacing DM creativity.

**Cognitive Augmentation:** Enhance human decision-making rather than replacing it - provide intelligent suggestions while keeping the DM in control.

**Performance First:** Prioritize speed and responsiveness in all interactions, ensuring the tool never disrupts the flow of a live session.

**D&D Domain Intelligence:** Build deep understanding of D&D concepts, relationships, and narrative patterns rather than generic note-taking functionality.

**Intuitive Interface:** Design for DMs who are focused on their players and story, not on learning complex software interfaces.

**Extensible Architecture:** Build modular systems that can adapt to different campaign styles and rule variants while maintaining core functionality.

## Constraints

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must run on consumer hardware. (No high end GPUs required.)
- Local-only processing limits AI model size and complexity
- SQLite database constraints for concurrent access and scalability
- Terminal User Interface limitations compared to rich GUI applications

**Resource Constraints:**
- Single developer project requiring careful scope management
- 8-week development timeline for initial implementation
- No budget for external APIs or cloud services
- Limited to open-source libraries and tools

**Domain Constraints:**
- Primary focus on D&D 5e ruleset initially
- English language support only in initial version
- Limited to text-based content (no image or audio processing)
- Campaign sizes limited by local storage and processing capabilities

**User Experience Constraints:**
- TUI interface learning curve for users accustomed to GUI applications
- Keyboard-focused interaction may not suit all user preferences
- Limited visual design options compared to modern web/desktop applications
