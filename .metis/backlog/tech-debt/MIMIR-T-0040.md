#### Missing Documentation
- Root-level CONTRIBUTING.md does not exist
- Root-level DEVELOPMENT.md does not exist
- No user installation guide
- No platform-specific release instructions

## Implementation Plan **[DOCUMENTATION]**

### Phase 1: Critical User-Facing Documentation (Priority: P0)
**Goal**: Enable users to install and run released versions

1. **Update Main README.md**
   - Add "Installation" section at top (before "Development Setup")
   - Include download links to GitHub Releases
   - Document macOS quarantine removal: `xattr -cr /Applications/Mimir.app`
   - Document Windows installation (extract and run .msi)
   - Document Linux installation (.deb, .AppImage)
   - Clearly separate "For Users" vs "For Developers"
   - Complete LICENSE section
   - Update placeholder GitHub URLs

2. **Update docs/src/README.md**
   - Change status from "Documentation Phase" to "Active Development - v0.0.1 Released"
   - Add link to installation instructions
   - Update GitHub issue/discussion links
   - Add "Getting Started" section for users

### Phase 2: Contributor Documentation (Priority: P1)
**Goal**: Enable developers to contribute to the project

3. **Create Root-Level CONTRIBUTING.md**
   - Code of conduct reference

   - Pull request process
   - Code style guidelines
   - Testing requirements
   - Commit message conventions (no emojis, no Claude/Anthropic references)
   - Link to DEVELOPMENT.md for setup

4. **Create Root-Level DEVELOPMENT.md**

   - Common development tasks
   - Troubleshooting development issues
   - Link to crate-specific READMEs

5. **Populate docs/src/CONTRIBUTING.md**
   - More detailed version of root CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Architecture overview
   - Design principles
   - PR review process
   - Release process

6. **Populate docs/src/DEVELOPMENT.md**
   - Comprehensive development guide
   - IDE setup recommendations
   - Debugging techniques
   - Database migrations guide
   - Frontend development workflow
   - Tauri-specific considerations

### Phase 3: Documentation Audit (Priority: P2)
**Goal**: Ensure all existing documentation is accurate

7. **Audit Crate READMEs**
   - Verify all version references are 0.0.1
   - Check for outdated commands or workflows
   - Ensure cross-references between crates are correct
   - Validate code examples still work

8. **Update Documentation Build**
   - Ensure mdBook builds correctly
   - Update SUMMARY.md if new sections added
   - Add installation and development guides to book

   - Platform-specific installation guides
   - Troubleshooting common installation issues
   - System requirements detailed guide
   - Upgrade instructions (future versions)

10. **Create docs/src/development/ Directory**
    - Getting started with development
    - Architecture deep dives
    - Contributing your first PR
    - Testing guide
    - Release process documentation

## Implementation Notes **[DOCUMENTATION]**

### Key Documentation Principles
1. **User-First**: Installation instructions should be for users downloading releases, not developers
2. **Platform-Specific**: Provide clear instructions for macOS, Windows, and Linux
3. **Two Audiences**: Separate "Users" (download releases) from "Developers" (build from source)
4. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology and formatting across all docs
5. **Accuracy**: Ensure all commands, paths, and versions are correct and tested

### macOS Quarantine Removal Command
When users download the app from GitHub releases on macOS, they need to remove the quarantine attribute:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Mimir.app
```
This is critical for v0.0.1 release usability.

### Documentation Dependencies
- GitHub repository URL (currently placeholder in README)
- License decision (Apache-2.0 OR MIT currently referenced)
- Release artifacts from CI/CD pipeline (MIMIR-T-0038)
- Actual GitHub Releases URL for download links

### Risk Considerations
1. **Incomplete Installation Instructions**: Users may fail to install if macOS quarantine removal not documented
2. **Confusing Development vs User Paths**: Must clearly separate these workflows
3. **Outdated References**: Need to update all placeholder URLs and version numbers
4. **Missing Contributor Guidelines**: May reduce quality of contributions without clear guidelines

## Status Updates **[REQUIRED]**
