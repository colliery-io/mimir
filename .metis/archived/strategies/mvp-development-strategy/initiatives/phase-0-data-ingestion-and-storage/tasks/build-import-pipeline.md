# Build Import Pipeline Orchestrator

## Description

Create the main import pipeline that imports standardized bundle archives, manages transactions, and provides progress reporting. This has been simplified to a single unified import process rather than multiple processors.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create unified BundleImporter struct
- [ ] Implement bundle validation and extraction
- [ ] Add atomic transaction management
- [ ] Build progress reporting with user feedback
- [ ] Add error recovery and rollback
- [ ] Integrate with main mimir CLI as import subcommand
- [ ] Add import logging and history

## Technical Notes

Key features:
- Single bundle â†’ database import workflow
- Bundle validation (manifest, structure, integrity)
- Atomic transactions (all or nothing)
- Progress bars with clear feedback
- Detailed error reporting with context
- Clean rollback on any failure
- Import performance tracking

## Dependencies

- Depends on: completed SQLite schema and bundle format specification
- Replaces: multiple processor architecture with unified approach
