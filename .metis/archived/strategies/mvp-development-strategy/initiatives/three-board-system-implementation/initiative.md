# Three-Board System Implementation Initiative

## Context

This initiative implements the Three-Board System that forms the core workflow management approach for campaign operations. The system organizes campaign elements across Backlog, Active, and Archive boards, providing DMs with a structured approach to managing campaign content and session preparation.

Building on the foundation established in Initiative 1, this implementation focuses on the workflow automation and board management features that differentiate our platform from basic campaign management tools. The Three-Board System represents our core value proposition for campaign workflow optimization.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Implement the Three-Board System workflow management (Backlog, Active, Archive boards)
- Create drag-and-drop interface for moving campaign elements between board states
- Build automated workflow rules and triggers for board transitions
- Implement board filtering, sorting, and search capabilities
- Create board-specific views optimized for different workflow stages
- Integrate board system with campaign planning and session preparation workflows
- Provide workflow analytics and bottleneck identification tools

**Non-Goals:**
- Real-time multiplayer board collaboration (single-user focus for MVP)
- Advanced workflow automation beyond basic rule triggers
- Integration with external project management tools (Trello, Asana, etc.)
- Complex approval workflows or multi-DM campaign management
- Advanced reporting and analytics beyond basic flow metrics
- Mobile-optimized board interfaces (desktop-first approach)

## Detailed Design

**Architecture Overview:**
- Vue 3 board interface components with drag-and-drop functionality using Vue Draggable Next
- SQLite database extension with board state tables and workflow rules
- Rust backend workflow engine for automated transitions and rule processing
- Real-time UI updates using Vue reactivity system for board state changes
- Integration points with existing campaign and document management systems

**Key Components:**

1. **Three-Board Interface**
   - Backlog Board: Campaign elements awaiting development or future use
   - Active Board: Current session content and immediate campaign elements
   - Archive Board: Completed, resolved, or retired campaign materials
   - Drag-and-drop functionality for seamless item movement between boards
   - Board-specific layouts optimized for different content types and workflow stages

2. **Board Items and Content Types**
   - NPCs: Character development stages from concept to active use to retirement
   - Locations: Design phases from initial concept through active use to historical reference
   - Adventures: Planning stages from outline through active play to completion
   - Plot Hooks: Development from initial idea through active pursuit to resolution
   - Session Notes: Planning through execution to archival reference
   - Custom Items: User-defined campaign elements with configurable workflow stages

3. **Workflow Rules Engine**
   - Automated transitions based on configurable triggers (time-based, status-based, dependency-based)
   - Rule templates for common campaign workflow patterns
   - Manual override capabilities for exceptional cases
   - Workflow validation to prevent invalid state transitions
   - Integration with calendar and session scheduling for time-based triggers

4. **Board Management Features**
   - Filtering by content type, priority, tags, or custom criteria
   - Sorting by creation date, last modified, priority, or alphabetical order
   - Search across all board items with full-text content matching
   - Board templates for different campaign styles (sandbox, linear, episodic)
   - Bulk operations for moving multiple items or applying batch updates

5. **Analytics and Flow Optimization**
   - Board velocity tracking (items moved per time period)
   - Bottleneck identification (items stuck in specific states)
   - Content aging alerts (items idle beyond thresholds)
   - Flow metrics dashboard with actionable insights
   - Workflow pattern analysis for optimization recommendations

**Data Models:**
- BoardItem: id, campaign_id, title, content_type, board_state, priority, tags, created/updated timestamps
- WorkflowRule: id, campaign_id, trigger_conditions, target_transitions, rule_enabled
- BoardConfiguration: id, campaign_id, board_layouts, filters, display_preferences
- FlowMetrics: campaign_id, metric_type, values, calculation_date

**Integration Architecture:**
- Document attachments link board items to detailed campaign materials
- Calendar integration for session-based workflow triggers
- Campaign roster integration for NPC and character relationship tracking
- Search integration across board items and attached documents

## Alternatives Considered

**Kanban-Style Board System (Trello/Jira approach):**
- Pros: Familiar interface pattern, well-understood workflow concepts
- Cons: Generic approach doesn't optimize for campaign-specific content types and workflows
- Rejected: Three-board system provides better semantic alignment with campaign management phases

**Getting Things Done (GTD) Task Management:**
- Pros: Proven productivity methodology, comprehensive task organization
- Cons: Individual-focused rather than campaign-focused, complex for DM workflow needs
- Rejected: Too generic and complex for campaign-specific workflow optimization

**Calendar-Based Campaign Management:**
- Pros: Time-based organization aligns with session scheduling
- Cons: Poor for content that doesn't have specific timing, difficult to visualize workflow states
- Rejected: Time-based organization insufficient for content state management

**Simple Todo List Approach:**
- Pros: Minimal complexity, easy to implement and understand
- Cons: No workflow visualization, poor organization for complex campaigns, no flow optimization
- Rejected: Insufficient structure for comprehensive campaign workflow management

**Multi-Board Kanban (Separate boards per content type):**
- Pros: Content-specific optimization, flexible board configuration
- Cons: Context switching between boards, difficult to see campaign-wide flow, complex navigation
- Rejected: Three-board approach provides better campaign-wide visibility and simpler navigation

**Status-Based Linear Workflow (Sequential stages):**
- Pros: Clear progression path, simple state management
- Cons: Inflexible for campaign content that doesn't follow linear progression
- Rejected: Campaign content often moves non-linearly between active and inactive states

**Integration with External Project Management Tools:**
- Pros: Leverage existing tools and workflows, no custom development needed
- Cons: Breaks local-first architecture, poor integration with campaign-specific data
- Rejected: Conflicts with local-first principle and campaign-specific optimization requirements
