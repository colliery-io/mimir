# Extract generic CatalogService trait to eliminate service duplication

*This template includes sections for various types of tasks. Delete sections that don't apply to your specific use case.*

## Parent Initiative **[CONDITIONAL: Assigned Task]**

[[Parent Initiative]]

## Objective **[REQUIRED]**

Extract common patterns from 20+ catalog services into a generic `CatalogService<T>` trait, eliminating ~4,000-5,000 LOC of duplicated code.

## Backlog Item Details **[CONDITIONAL: Backlog Item]**

{Delete this section when task is assigned to an initiative}

### Type
- [ ] Bug - Production issue that needs fixing
- [ ] Feature - New functionality or enhancement  
- [ ] Tech Debt - Code improvement or refactoring
- [ ] Chore - Maintenance or setup work

### Priority
- [ ] P0 - Critical (blocks users/revenue)
- [ ] P1 - High (important for user experience)
- [ ] P2 - Medium (nice to have)
- [ ] P3 - Low (when time permits)

### Impact Assessment **[CONDITIONAL: Bug]**
- **Affected Users**: {Number/percentage of users affected}
- **Reproduction Steps**: 
  1. {Step 1}
  2. {Step 2}
  3. {Step 3}
- **Expected vs Actual**: {What should happen vs what happens}

### Business Justification **[CONDITIONAL: Feature]**
- **User Value**: {Why users need this}
- **Business Value**: {Impact on metrics/revenue}
- **Effort Estimate**: {Rough size - S/M/L/XL}

### Technical Debt Impact **[CONDITIONAL: Tech Debt]**
- **Current Problems**: 20 services (action_service.rs, feat_service.rs, spell_service.rs, etc.) in `crates/mimir-dm-core/src/services/` have nearly identical patterns: `search_*()`, `get_*_by_id()`, `get_sources()`, `import_*_from_book()`, `remove_*_by_source()`. Bug fixes must be replicated across all services manually.
- **Benefits of Fixing**: 50-60% reduction in service code, universal bug fixes, easier to add new catalog types, reduced onboarding complexity.
- **Risk Assessment**: Without fixing, adding new catalog types requires ~300 LOC of boilerplate. Bug fixes will continue to be inconsistently applied.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria **[REQUIRED]**

- [ ] Generic `CatalogService<T>` trait defined with default implementations for common methods
- [ ] At least 3 services migrated to use the trait (e.g., ActionService, FeatService, BackgroundService)
- [ ] All existing tests pass after migration
- [ ] New catalog type can be added with <50 LOC of service code
