# Split character/mod.rs (64k LOC) into focused submodules

*This template includes sections for various types of tasks. Delete sections that don't apply to your specific use case.*

## Parent Initiative **[CONDITIONAL: Assigned Task]**

[[Parent Initiative]]

## Objective **[REQUIRED]**

Split the 64,742 LOC character/mod.rs into focused submodules (<20k LOC each) with clear interfaces between concerns.

## Backlog Item Details **[CONDITIONAL: Backlog Item]**

{Delete this section when task is assigned to an initiative}

### Type
- [ ] Bug - Production issue that needs fixing
- [ ] Feature - New functionality or enhancement  
- [ ] Tech Debt - Code improvement or refactoring
- [ ] Chore - Maintenance or setup work

### Priority
- [ ] P0 - Critical (blocks users/revenue)
- [ ] P1 - High (important for user experience)
- [ ] P2 - Medium (nice to have)
- [ ] P3 - Low (when time permits)

### Impact Assessment **[CONDITIONAL: Bug]**
- **Affected Users**: {Number/percentage of users affected}
- **Reproduction Steps**: 
  1. {Step 1}
  2. {Step 2}
  3. {Step 3}
- **Expected vs Actual**: {What should happen vs what happens}

### Business Justification **[CONDITIONAL: Feature]**
- **User Value**: {Why users need this}
- **Business Value**: {Impact on metrics/revenue}
- **Effort Estimate**: {Rough size - S/M/L/XL}

### Technical Debt Impact **[CONDITIONAL: Tech Debt]**
- **Current Problems**: `crates/mimir-dm-core/src/services/character/mod.rs` is 64,742 LOC (10x average module size). Contains 8+ mixed concerns: creation, leveling, rendering, spell management, inventory, progression, class features, ability scores. Impossible to understand or safely modify.
- **Benefits of Fixing**: Reduced cognitive load, easier testing of individual concerns, lower regression risk, better code navigation and IDE performance.
- **Risk Assessment**: High risk of introducing bugs when modifying character logic. New developers cannot understand the system. Testing requires understanding entire file.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria **[REQUIRED]**

- [ ] mod.rs split into 4-6 focused submodules (creation, leveling, spells, inventory, rendering, etc.)
- [ ] No single module exceeds 20k LOC
- [ ] Clear public interfaces between modules (no circular dependencies)
- [ ] All existing character tests pass
- [ ] Character functionality unchanged from user perspective
