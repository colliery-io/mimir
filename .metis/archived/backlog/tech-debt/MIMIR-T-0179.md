# Standardize service initialization pattern (conn vs &self)

*This template includes sections for various types of tasks. Delete sections that don't apply to your specific use case.*

## Parent Initiative **[CONDITIONAL: Assigned Task]**

[[Parent Initiative]]

## Objective **[REQUIRED]**

Standardize how services are initialized and receive database connections - either all take `&mut SqliteConnection` as parameter, or all use `&self` with internal connection management.

## Backlog Item Details **[CONDITIONAL: Backlog Item]**

{Delete this section when task is assigned to an initiative}

### Type
- [ ] Bug - Production issue that needs fixing
- [ ] Feature - New functionality or enhancement  
- [ ] Tech Debt - Code improvement or refactoring
- [ ] Chore - Maintenance or setup work

### Priority
- [ ] P0 - Critical (blocks users/revenue)
- [ ] P1 - High (important for user experience)
- [ ] P2 - Medium (nice to have)
- [ ] P3 - Low (when time permits)

### Impact Assessment **[CONDITIONAL: Bug]**
- **Affected Users**: {Number/percentage of users affected}
- **Reproduction Steps**: 
  1. {Step 1}
  2. {Step 2}
  3. {Step 3}
- **Expected vs Actual**: {What should happen vs what happens}

### Business Justification **[CONDITIONAL: Feature]**
- **User Value**: {Why users need this}
- **Business Value**: {Impact on metrics/revenue}
- **Effort Estimate**: {Rough size - S/M/L/XL}

### Technical Debt Impact **[CONDITIONAL: Tech Debt]**
- **Current Problems**: Mixed service patterns - some services use `ServiceName::method(conn, ...)` (stateless), others use `service.method(...)` (stateful with internal conn). Inconsistent API surface confuses developers.
- **Benefits of Fixing**: Predictable API pattern, easier to understand which services need connections passed in, clearer ownership model.
- **Risk Assessment**: Low - inconsistency is confusing but functional. Standardizing improves developer experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria **[REQUIRED]**

- [ ] Decision documented: stateless (conn param) vs stateful (&self) pattern
- [ ] All catalog services follow chosen pattern
- [ ] All campaign services follow chosen pattern
- [ ] Pattern documented in ARCHITECTURE.md or service module docs
- [ ] All tests pass after standardization
