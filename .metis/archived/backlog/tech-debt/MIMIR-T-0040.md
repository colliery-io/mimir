7. **Audit Crate READMEs**
   - Verify all version references are 0.0.1
   - Check for outdated commands or workflows
   - Ensure cross-references between crates are correct
   - Validate code examples still work

8. **Update Documentation Build**

## Implementation Notes **[DOCUMENTATION]**

### Key Documentation Principles
1. **User-First**: Installation instructions should be for users downloading releases, not developers
2. **Platform-Specific**: Provide clear instructions for macOS, Windows, and Linux
3. **Two Audiences**: Separate "Users" (download releases) from "Developers" (build from source)
4. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology and formatting across all docs
5. **Accuracy**: Ensure all commands, paths, and versions are correct and tested

### macOS Quarantine Removal Command
When users download the app from GitHub releases on macOS, they need to remove the quarantine attribute:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Mimir.app
```
This is critical for v0.0.1 release usability.

### Documentation Dependencies
- GitHub repository URL (currently placeholder in README)
- License decision (Apache-2.0 OR MIT currently referenced)
- Release artifacts from CI/CD pipeline (MIMIR-T-0038)
- Actual GitHub Releases URL for download links

### Risk Considerations
1. **Incomplete Installation Instructions**: Users may fail to install if macOS quarantine removal not documented
2. **Confusing Development vs User Paths**: Must clearly separate these workflows
3. **Outdated References**: Need to update all placeholder URLs and version numbers
4. **Missing Contributor Guidelines**: May reduce quality of contributions without clear guidelines
